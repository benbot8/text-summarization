              "\"welcome everyone to the October installment of the task of Webinar series. Um, it's my very great pleasure to introduce fresh Nigel Stratton from the Manchester Institute of Biotechnology in Manchester University, who will be talking about microbial cell factor factories. Sorry, I've lost my ability to read, um, an engineering biology for chemical production. Um, I will hand straight over tonight, all but if you could use the Q and A function to ask questions and we will answer all the questions at the end. Do you have any technical difficulties or any issues or would like to introduce yourself and let us know where you're from? Please use the chat button. Um, on on that, I will hand straight over to Professor Scrutton. Okay, Thank you very much. Thanks. Very, very kind introduction. It's a pleasure to be with you all this afternoon and for me to be able to tell you about our recent work on engineering biology for chemicals production and by manufacturing. So what I'd like to do today is to discuss our work on establish establishing an automated by a foundry for microbial strain engineering and the impact that this is having on chemicals and fuels production, and then how some of this work is now being translated to scale for the commercial production of selected advanced fuels. Mhm. So we're just to provide some context, of course, by manufacturing is a significant contributor to the UK economy and we're now on the cusp. I think of rapid expansion of this sector as we urgently try to find solutions to meet global challenges, for example, the government's clean growth and zero carbon agendas. This is especially important, I think, in the UK chemicals manufacturing sector, which includes over 3000 businesses employing around about 100 and 53,000 people and giving something like 19 billion in gross value added to a turnover around about 55 billion. So, of course, the majority of this comes from petrochemicals. The fact that's increasingly odds with the Paris Agreement obligations and 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. So clearly and urgently, we need to change and transition to a more sustainable by manufacturing sector. That's part of the UK's economic recovery as we build back better following the global pandemic. Now, of course, the U. K is recognized as a world leader in biotechnology. And, uh, this is especially true in the research base, which delivers first rate discovery science. Uh huh. The UK, however, needs to do better at building back from this science based to implement sustainable by manufacturing technologies and bring them to market. And I guess pre pandemic. The UK produced multiple roadmaps, many of them you see on the slide here and vision documents to shape future investment in infrastructure training and science and technology programmes to rapidly grow the industrial biotechnology base. And so I guess there's no better time than now to capitalize on these developments, especially as we approach the next U. N Climate change conference in Glasgow in 2021 as we aim to build back better through clean growth. So what I hope to convince you of this afternoon is that the vibe or the Manchester instituted by technology, we're developing a research environment to tackle the science and technology challenges of establishing a bio based manufacturing economy, especially in the areas of fuels and chemicals. And over the years, um, it has assembled a strong interdisciplinary research community working together across the biology, chemistry, materials, engineering and competition, all science areas that it really has enabled us to address ambitious challenge led research programs. And of course, we were delighted to be recognized earlier this year through the award of the Queen's anniversary prize. Recognizing MIB leadership in the UK's strategic development of biotechnology and by manufacturing through innovative technologies and partnerships with industry now in what we've done is to assemble a number of capability platforms that have often been supported by major investments from you Care I and industry. And these are provided focal points for the development of new technology platforms for engineering biology and for forming interactions with external groups and industry to help pull through academic discoveries towards industrial application. What I want to do today is focus on two key research areas. Synthetic biology and bike analysis, but also supported by work we've been doing in the structural and biophysics analysis of enzyme systems. So in 2014, we established symbol became one of the six synthetic biology research centres supported by the B B S. R. C as a platform center for the rapid engineering of microbial strains for fine and specialty chemicals based on a bespoke design built Tesla and platform that we've developed within the center. The chemicals production pipeline starts at the design stage shown in purple here, where we set out blueprints for engineered microbial strains using a suite of design algorithms for rapid strain engineering. These include design tools for retros, emphasis in the cell and the design of extended metabolic pathways to access new chemical space and enzyme selection and engineering tools. We can then design and select DNA parts, combine them into a plasmid libraries using automated assembly instructions and high throughput robotics and the built stage, then prepares us for the assembly of these genetically encoded parts and assembles them into plasmids via, for example, like cycling reactions according to automatically generated work lists that drive the laboratory automation and the fidelity of assemble pathways is then checked, for example, by high throughput restriction analysis and capillary electrophoresis, or by Nana for DNA sequencing. And then the test stage encompasses hide throughput methods for the growth of microbial production cultures, automated product extraction and screening via fast liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. The results are analyzed in the loan stage of the blue shaded panel on the slide through predictive models using statistical methods of machine learning to inform the next round of design and after a number of iterations of this DBT l cycle, successful prototypes are then taken forward to process development and scale up. And so, in establishing the symbiotic pipeline, we set out really to achieve a number of objectives. First of all, the pipeline should be agnostic to the target compound that we want to produce and also, to certain extent to the host bacterial organism so that we can support the production of many different chemicals from different host organisms. Secondly, it should leverage high throughput automation to ensure rapid delivery of new strains, and this improved performance should also reduce human error in the engineering programs. Third, we set out to provide software, platforms and expertise that could then be readily adopted by the wider synthetic biology community. Development of the symbiotic by founder concept was really phased in phase one that we focus very much on developing the underpinning capabilities of the pipeline around three target groups of compounds. There's been flavonoids, Turpin's and alkaloids example of groups, and then in the second phase, we then tested the pipeline in anger, carrying out a stress test to determine how many materials modern is, for example, that we could produce from biology in a three month window using the symbiotic um, capabilities. So in the first stress test, we set ourselves the challenge of seeing how many materials modern as we could produce by engineering E. Coli Using the pipeline and in discussions with local material scientists at Manchester, we identified a list of monomer targets used widely by industry, and a selection of these targets from the list was chosen based on monomers that were either found in natural bio synthesis routes or ones that are by synthetic by synthetically accessible, based on literature, information and perspective by a retro synthetic research, we selected 25 targets encompassing seven compound classes that were either materials, monitors or compound precursors. These encompassed vinyl, benzene, xylene, benzene, mandalay, Tsai's a beautiful compounds, dials, dines and dark, a box fillets, each with our own application areas in polymer chemistry. We then set ourselves a notional 90 day limit to walk through the design, build test and learn cycle to identify how many unique strains capable of synthesizing these products could be engineered, but also to characterize general properties such as the titles of products in laboratory fermentation and to identify potential strains that could enter a second DBT L cycle. Focus this time on optimizing Titus to reach graham polluter levels suitable for large scale production. So for each class of chemical target, new synthetic metabolic pathways were selected following the symbiotic, an automated approach which involves the use of retro synthesis software enzyme candidates for each step were selected using our design algorithm, cell enzyme and via file, a genetic analysis and the target compounds and primary tab. A light precursors are represented here by skeletal formula, whilst other E. Coli metabolites are represented by abbreviations. Now, the continuous arrows on the on the slide represents single enzyme step, whereas successive barriers represent multiple enzymatic transformations towards the target compound. So target successfully produced. A new coal is shown in green. Those in red were from the original target list, but for which enzymatic routes to their production were not found. Orange targets were produced enigmatically in vitro, but not during fermentation of E. Coli, and the blue structures identified compounds in which the title was raised substantially by engineering E. Coli, for example, by knocking out competing pathways or by boosting expression of bio catalysts in the cell through further rounds of strain engineering. The entire DB TL engineering cycle was completed in automated fashion within 85 days. The success of the rapid design and engineering of new bacterial strange reveals the power we believe of the prototyping strategy of the bio foundry approach and discovering new pathways that can lead to chemical space not naturally found in biology. We subsequently took a small selection of these strains that have been engineered to produce Mandel eight and Hydroxy Mandel eight and put them through a second stress test with the objective of increasing Titus to the Grand Pelita scale. That second stress test was likewise successful driving titles into the 1 to 10 g per liter scale values that are now suitable for consideration of production scale up for these compounds. So if we look at the outcome of the stress test is a simple numbers gallery, we can get a feel for the capabilities of the construct of pipeline within the 85 day limit. We designed and created 160 unique genetic parts by DNA synthesis. We constructed them verified by sequencing 187 unique pathway constructs assembled. Using our automated like cycling reaction methods, we performed over 150 unique enzyme assays created nine mutant E. Coli chassis is using, for example, genome engineering methods that we analyze more than 8000 samples using mass spectrometry as part of the integrated test platform, and we developed 22 new mess quantification methods. The outcome is that from a standing a standing starting point, we create a prototype strains for 17 out of the original 25 monomers of interest, and we were able to access biologically five out of seven classes of identified monomer types. So overall, we estimate that the personnel and consumable costs amounted to around about £15,000 per successful target, corresponding to 360 personnel hours compound. And this rigorous and comprehensive benchmarking study we feel now showcases the ability of Bali founder is to provide quick and affordable access to a diverse range of chemicals by microbial fermentation and how these early prototype strains can now be optimized and scaled up to achieve. Graham pleaded fermentation as a basis for large scale production, so we've also been interested in exploring biological diversity and chemical diversity using the bio foundry approach. And for some time now we've been exploring Turpin chemistry as an attractive playground for microbial chemicals production, as the Turpin's group is naturally very diverse, with up to around about 80 known compounds in nature. In the interests of focusing on the subset of these compounds, we concentrated on the monitor pins, which are C 10 compounds. Made from the eyes open are precursors isa fentanyl, die phosphate and dimethyl ala di phosphate. Now, many of these monitor peons have major industrial applications and are used widely, for example, as flavorings, fragrances and antiseptics. There are also important precursors for pharmaceuticals, bio plastics and fuels. Currently, they are obtained from either agricultural sources, which are subject to seasonal variation, crop yields and use land that, frankly, could be better repurpose for, for example, for producing food or their synthesized chemically, which in itself is a challenge, given their overall complex structures and the existence of multiple stereo centers. And this drives up the cost of production and purification of the desired products. So we set out to discover if compounds of this type could be made readily using synthetic biology and to create a plug and play microbial prototype strain that could produce a vast array of Turpin's. And, if successful with an interested to see is selected, strains could be optimized further to support production at scale. So during the early development phases of the symbiote can pipeline, we focused on three chemical groups. As I said previously, Turpin's Flavonoids and Alkaloids, our first demonstration of the pipeline with flavonoids alkaloids, was published in 2018 prior to the material stress test that I mentioned earlier. The Turpin work has been progressing over an extended timeline to build up a series of strange and genetically encoded parts to make a vast array of Turpin's in engineered microbial strains, some of which are currently being scaled for specific applications with with industry partners. And again, what I hope to do is to convince you that the Bio Founder is and the engineering of biology provide attractive alternative routes to the production of a range of industrial important chemicals and also potentially expand the chemical reach beyond that easily attainable using synthetic chemistry methods. So on this line, I call this, uh, image, uh, monitor pinwheel. It indicates the skeletal structures of all monitor pin scaffolds derived from the precursor as a paranoid shown at the bottom of the the bottom of the wheel shown here, we can identify three subgroups. The Bice I click monitor pins, the motorcycling and the A cyclic monitor pins. Under objective was to engineer prototype strains that can make each of these compounds as a basis for further optimization and ultimately scale up for production. The first task was to engineer the feeder pathway that gives rise to a common substrates For all these Turpin's that's journal de Phosphate. We and others have created such pathways using variants of the so called endogenous MPP pathways, which generally results in low interest in the levels of the ISA paranoid precursors or using a hydrologist envy, a pathway that we have created an optimist in recent years to balance carbon flux and stability when contained in a tetralogy is host. After synthesizing these pathways for progressive supply, our objective was then to introduce a library of monitor ping psych lasers into the host train, using a plug and play approach to switch on the synthesis of the desired monetary cream product. Now, initially, we targeted 2 to 3 non plant Turpin cycles is for each individual scaffold, taken from a diverse source of a diverse source of different plants and the hope of detecting and quantifying the monitor PM product produced from the engineers' trains. This then opens up additional D PTL engineering, for example, to optimize product. Titus minimize cited toxicity of the products and enable tailoring of the scaffolds to make higher higher value products. So early designs were relatively straightforward. We set up a two plasmid system with the feeder pathways contained in a single place. We've shown here, uh, and with a second plastic containing journal de phosphate, the entry enzyme that is required to form a G D. P, on which the Turpin cyclists can then act switching in and out of different Turpin cyclers enzymes that enables production of different target monitor paeans to be studied. The to feed the pathways were engineered and optimize using enzymes taken from multiple organisms. Color coded has shown shown here, and fine tuning of metabolic flux through this engineered of a pathway was also achieved through machine learning to affect translational tuning of individual genes using libraries, synthetic rubbers on binding sites to boost production Titus by over 60% when screening under 3% of arrivals on binding site library MM to facilitate library screening, a multi well plate fermentation procedure was developed, allowing increased screening throughout throughput with sufficient resolution to discriminate between high and low producers. This early optimization has helped to balance the flux through the NVA pathway, when coupled with further engineering, has led to the production of stable and optimist plastic constructs for the production of the required ISA paranoid precursors. So what we have achieved is the creation of a first generation library of E. Coli strains that can make every natural monitor being scaffold represented in the so called monitor P wheel. This then gives us access to a generalist platform of E. Coli strains as a starting point for optimization for scale up and also for further chemical tailoring and to facilitate tailing. And we also generated an extensive bike analysis toolkit for the oxy functional ization of Turpin's. By designing and building a cytochrome P 4 50 enzyme collection and testing it in a custom made untargeted GCMS met economics based approach, we're able to rapidly create and characteristics a comprehensive library for the controlled oxy functional ization of Turpin scaffold with a wide range of activities and selectivity, is towards all the monitor being shown here. We can now use this novel by cattle IT resource to access the extensive chemical diversity of Turpin Lloyds by further pathway engineering through the assembly of by catalytic cascades to subsequently produced libraries of oxygenated Turpin roids and their derivatives for diverse applications, for example, Turpin based drug discovery. So the outcome of the first generation engineering is shown here, both in terms of product profiles and indeed, titles achieved for each of them all Turpin scaffold. We were able to produce more than 30 different monitor paranoids from glucose using 20 different Turpin synthesizers. Several novel scaffolds were generated not previously produced in engineered microbes before, and initial production levels were exceeded for most. Where selected examples have been previously produced and engineered microbes, most Turpin synthesis how they produced multiple products and in particular complex bys. I click products where typically only 60 to 70% of the total Turpin product is of the bicycling type. Some compounds are produced at very low titles, as we can see here, and examples include targets that we were particularly interested in Little Lulu. And finally, what is striking overall is that the product profile profiles were generally very complex and multiple products were obtained with most psych lasers or Turpin synthesizers, and a range of product titles were obtained. These were affected by many things. Optimizing the pathway flux, enzyme expression, minimizing side product formation and controlling the effects of sight of toxicity are all important factors in determining the final title obtained. Moreover, engineering individual Turpin synthesizers or finding alternative catalysts in native to give cleaner products is clearly a priority for large scale production of these compounds. Now, the reasons for the complex product profiles have found really in the mechanistic details of the mode of action of Turpin synthesis. These enzymes initiate the reaction cascade by eliminating the dye phosphate of journal Die Phosphates and on the left here to form the journal. Katyn has also shown here on the second the second structure on the slide. This then undergoes I summarization to form the Little Island terminal captains at any point along the reaction Cade cascade. These reactive enzyme intermediates can undergo further chemical reactions such as inter molecular attack on all offending double bombs, hydride or protein migrations and rearrangements to change the structure of the chemical staff. Scaffold. Ultimately, the reactive intermediates to quench by deep rooted nation or nuclear filic. Attack by water now hydrophobic residues in the enzyme active site for this rather oily substrate binding pocket. I make the comparison here with an ice cream scoop and that we can mold the active site. But we really give it little chemical identity to specifically position the substrate in the active site. This hydrophobic binding pocket protects the Qatar nick intermediates from the undirected attack of water and aromatic residues stabilised the charged intermediates by Qatar and pie interactions. Now these relatively inert active sites means it's very. There's very little overall sequence similarity between different Turpin psych lasers, with the exception of small finger printer Sparta rich sequence motifs close, uh, and and and the second short motif, which is involved in binding the magnesium co factors. This lack of overall sequence identity really complicates any attempt at rational design of the of these enzymes, season structure and sequence guided protein engineering. And this is clearly a problem when one has the objective to really tighten up product profiles, for example, for the production of the clean products in our microbial cell factories. Um, this is a major engineering challenge for this particular field. So given the complex product profiles obtained with many of the natural plant Turpin synthesis, more recently we switched our attention to mining Turpin synthesis from bacterial species. And given the poor sequence conservation in the active site, we used a hidden Markov model in thematic search of bacterial genome sequences to identify new Turpin, cyclers and enzymes. Using this approach, we've identified 2867 punitive new bacterial Turpin synthesis using the two finger print motifs I discussed briefly on the previous slide. And then we select a multiple examples and characterize their overall activity using, for example, GCMs type analysis. Most were shown to be Cesc utopian and dystopian synthesis, and only a few were shown to be monitor prion synthesis. That said, we have identified specific line Alou and serial Turpin synthesis we've got on to determine their X ray structures and product profiles and showing these are in fact, far superior as catalysts for producing those compounds in microbial cell factories compared to the plant enzymes. So we've shown that the bacterial enzymes are simpler instruction. Um, more importantly, given much more restrictive product profiles, as I say, the bacterial signal and linear altarpieces. Since this does not only give cleaner product profiles but predominantly form a single product in lifestyle fermentation, it also enables much higher Titus to be reached for these particular products in our plug and play platform. And this then enables us to begin to consider whether we can scale up some of these prototypes strains to produce these compounds that ground per liter levels. Okay, so what I hope I've done so far is to show that the by foundry approach is certainly useful and rapidly generating prototypical strains. There can be then further optimized for large scale fermentation, but also give you access to chemistry that may be difficult to access using conventional synthetic methods, uh, and therefore that really demonstrates the power of biology in rapidly generating a palliative like of different chemical structures from a common from a common scaffold. What I'd like to do now is to change tack a little bit and show you how microbial cell factory engineering can also be used to make fuels from biology. We've worked for the last seven or eight years and continue to do so on a production of liquefied petroleum gas, or LPG, from engineered microbial strains using fermented and photo catalytic processes. This is a story that's gone from early strain development to large scale production of bio LPGA pilots demonstrated scale and, in recent years, the establishment of a field from biology company called C three biotech that we established, which is currently scaling and commercializing our bio LPG production technologies. So the obvious question, first of all, is why target LPG? Well, first of all, it's important to appreciate the L. P. G varies across the world, predominantly comprises propane, but there are varying amounts of butane and other combustible gases present depending on where you source the gas globally in the U. K L. P. G. Is almost entirely propane in composition and its manufacturer is is clearly from fossil sources. Now L. P G is a very clean burning transport fuel, currently around about 22 million tons per annum, and it holds an important position in domestic heating markets used in about 40 million homes worldwide is also used extensively in cooking as a non greenhouse gas refrigerant and also as an aerosol propellant. There are commercial technologies out there. Yesterday, for example, developed an energy intensive chemical process for conversion of bio based glycerol. Two propane. But as yet a true biological roots to LPG has not yet been commercialized. Now L. P G is an excellent fuel. There are low energy costs required for its liquefaction. It's easily transported, and it's a non greenhouse gas, and therefore it compares favorably to other alkaline gas fuels such as methane, which is a major greenhouse gas produced from traditional anaerobic digestion plants. So all this combines to make L. P G. I think, an attractive target for production using microbial cell factories. And that's the journey that we set out to to to follow over the last seven or 87 or eight years. Now, in thinking about this, I actually think it's worth really reflecting on what is the end product. What do we want to achieve here so that we can begin to think about how we can design the biology to fit fit the end game as it were? So this is my forward thinking slide. We need to ask what a bio LPG production plant might look like on the long term so that the engineering and process characteristics and overall economics of setting up and running such a plant could be fed back into early stage microbial strain engineering. To ensure that the biology is aligned with the larger scale engineering challenges. Consequent, we've taken a bottom up systems engineering approach to inform the overall design clearly feedstock supplies central. We need to be able to target, for example, carbon dioxide or industrial wastes, or perhaps agriculture on food and biomass waste, which are in plentiful supply in the UK We shouldn't be reliant on freshwater, which is potentially scarce in certain regions of the world and also adds an initial cost burden in terms of the operation of such a plant. So our process is, therefore need to run on seawater or brackish water. We want to use them out in the field we need to obtain, we need to we need to be clean and carbon mutual bio RPGs have explained, is a clean burning fuel and distributed manufacturer for local use would certainly minimize transportation costs and further carbon burden We also require simple downstream processing to mitigate against major costs. So by embedding production into the existing infrastructures for production transport, we essentially have a drop in solution. We need to tailor to different waste streams so we can be used effectively across the globe. And there needs to be a low Capex and OPEC's burden across the supply chain for its production, use and transport. So these are the sort of guiding principles that there were clearly thinking about in terms of developing a biological process for LPG production. So let's return to the basic science. Uh, first of all, we need to develop a biological route to propane. Propane is not produced in nature, so there is no existing natural pathways or enzymes that can be repurposed for its scale for for large scale production. So our early inroads were therefore to design new metabolic pathways for its production and to source an engineer enzymes that could use a biologically sourced metabolite and turn that into propane gas. So, using the DBT L type principle, we created a new version of the cluster deal fermentation pathway to butin all but crucially adapted it to include newly discovered enzyme. Aldo Heidi Formulating our oxygen is or radios it's labeled, and you can see that in blue on the on the right hand panel at the bottom. Uh, and we set about to engineer this to work with short chain Aldo height substrates such as beautiful Aldo High. Our first target host was E. Coli because of ease and speed of genetic manipulation, as we've shown in the previous stress test with our material monitors, but with a view that any prototypical pathway discovered could then be transferred to a more robust industrial host that could be used effectively out in the field. So the general approach, the early approaches summarized here. We slept in a number of known by catalysts for each individual step in the conceptual metabolic pathways to propane and synthesizing DNA to encode these and assemble them into plasmid encoded pathways in the modular fashion. Using different plastic combinations, we then explore alternative routes along the pathway, as identified by the hatched shown here, as well as using bio catalyst supplied by nature. We also have to repurpose selector catalyst to improve the target chemistry, especially for the radio enzyme, which is a slow enzyme that works best with Long hair and Aldo hides. Having assembled these early pathways, we then set out to optimist by switching on and switching out new variants or by eliminating competing pathways through targeted knock out of jeans to ensure we direct metabolites to the desired product. Propane, so repurpose in a video by protein engineering was the first challenge. The enzyme works best with long chain alga heights. And to get a molecular view of this, uh, how the substrate since we solve the crystal structure of radio in the presence of its surrogate ligand problematic acid, which coiffure purifies with the enzyme from E. Coli. And here you can see that the substrate accesses the active site through a long hydrophobic channel with a boxful group being presented to the Diane Center, which is the area, uh, of Potala. Sis conjectured that hysteric blocking of this channel would exclude long chain substrates and perhaps favor the binding a short chain Alba High. So a number of single and multiple mutations were made the most effective being the replacement of residue. Alan E. 134 for Alan in. You can see that in the slide here you can see the red album side chain blocking off that channel, and the structure of that variant indicated the design intentions were carried it through in crystal structures with short urging substrates. We then introduced the the engineered enzymes into plastic constructs, where we had assembled parts of the pathway genes leading from the cell metabolite acetyl coa way through to the final product propane fermentation of a 12 hour period analytical skill that indicated that in fact, propane was now generated using this pathway, albeit in relatively small amounts. But despite the low Titus, this was the first Clostridium like fermentation pathway shown to produce propane gas and establishes an important proof of concept. The title is dependent on the metabolic route followed, as indicated by the red and the green bars. Beyond these proof of concept studies at lab scale, exploratory five and 400 liter scales have also been demonstrated, and the low tighter is clearly a challenge, in part due to the very low activity of radio. We've engaged in both directed evolution and rational engineering studies of video. But improvements in catalytic activity here are hard one and hindered by the fact that we still unsure what is limiting in the overall cabinet cycle of this intriguing enzyme. So on this slide you can visualize an airlift fermenter that we developed in C three Biotech, the spin out company to investigate early scale of challenges of appropriate production. Using the engineer coli strains that we produced, E. Coli is supported using glycerol from a re processing plant. Uh, from this movie, which I, I hope works on screen here, we just generate. I guess it might not work because I can't access my cursor. There it is from this movie here, you can hope. I'm not sure it's going to work. Ah, there it is. You can actually see a mixture of propane, another flammable gases burning from this early fermenter. Uh, there's propane in there. It's not entirely propane. It's a mixture of of other final gases as well. But this really does at least demonstrate a proof of concept that propane can produce. To some extent, uh, in this larger scale, uh, fermented. Yeah, there are challenges here. Clearly, this is not a system that we would want to scale at this at this stage. Because of the low titles produced, the cost of setting up sterile fermentation. Uh, we we with E. Coli and many of the engineering challenges that we set out. And in the end, we have decided that in fact, radio is probably not the ideal enzyme to the supporting short chain alcohol production in microbial cell factories. So armed with that knowledge that radios and like to support this large scale production in M. I B number of us in the institute have been looking at other potential enzymes that could give rise to vulnerable fuels. Uh, for example, we've had a M. I. B Y program on mechanism and structure of a number of enzymes, which can be used to produce Calkins al canes. And indeed, Turpin fuels that I've mentioned briefly. Some of those enzymes are shown here, but really, the game changer for us was the report in science in 2017 of a new photo enzyme isolated from algae, which using blue light and like a box of long chain fatty acids into short, too short chain al canes. So within that paper in science, the structure of the enzyme was reported by Sergei. It'll and it's provided the required insight into long chain fatty acid binding in the active site cliff that could be targeted for rational design towards substrates. The national Catholic cycle was also presented by these authors involving FD photo chemistry to Deco oxalate, the fatty acid, using excited state flavor in chemistry. And as part of the characterization of the enzyme, we've done further spectroscopic analyses of this particular catalyst to determine its overall reaction mechanism. These studies were reported recently in CSKA Talese's earlier this year Brief. We were able to demonstrate that Red Intermediate is formed even under the cryogenic conditions that is below the glass phase transition of proteins, implying that the chemical changes not dependent on larger scale protein motion. But the decay of that red intermediate is very much dependent on protein structural change because that only happens at temperatures above the glass phase transition. I won't dwell on those studies today. The paper is there if anyone's interested to follow up. We were also able using laser excitation experiments to look at proton transfer and hygiene transfer reactions associated with the formation decay of that red intermediate and were able to begin to deconstruct the overall reaction mechanism and proton transfer pathways and indeed identify key residues in the active site. And I pointed to the sustained residue assisting 432 that we showed is involved in formation decay of that particular red intermediate. What that means is that we've been able to advance now our understanding of the overall reaction mechanism. First of all, this concerns sister and residue is found in all fat monologues. F AP Hama logs are shown in the sequence alignment here, emphasizing its potential importance of the photo chemistry. That system is close to the FAA Deco factor, and we believe it gets involved in the chemistry through a series of hygiene transfer and electron transfer reactions. Essentially, what happens is that following Flavin excitation, we then get home Olympic vision of the carbon carbon bond on the substrate to form CO two, and Al came radical, and that arcane radical is then satisfied by H atom. Transfer from this active site sustain to form a violent radical species, which can translate form an interaction with the F D. That's the road intermediate and then relax back to the resting form of the enzyme. So armed with this knowledge, we now have a clearer understanding of mechanism, and this can be factored into rational engineering of the enzyme specificity. Our strategy is shown here, of course, in classical, anaerobic digestion, type processes or indeed, other processes derived from widely available biomass. You can get volatile fatty acids, streams. We can then think about Dick approximating those volatile fatty acids using a single enzymatic step using the photo Dick approximates to form propane, isa, butane and and beauty. So our overall strategy was to go in that particular direction. But of course, the fatty acid further decay Box Hill is predominantly works with long chain Aldo Heights. And our first challenge is really to try and re profile, if you like the specificity of that enzyme to work with with with shorter chain with short chain fatty acids, right? Uh huh. So we created a series of, uh, mutant constructs, uh, informed by the structure. Uh, and you can see on this sequence, uh, window here were able to identify residues which are involved in a redefining. If you like the substrate specificity of this enzyme. We've generated many variants of, uh, FAP in an extensive media genesis cycle, some of single substitution. So there are multiple substitutions, but we've been able to sort of, uh if you like, I identify a sequence window where key changes can really alter the specificity of, uh, of this enzyme for short chain for short chain, valuable, volatile fatty acids, and we can see some of the screening outputs here. So here we now have variants, which are able to work with both C three and C four hydrocarbon fatty acids and and indeed, C three C four hydrocarbon blends. That's important because wherever you are in the world, of course, L P G comprises propane, butane or other short chains. And you might want to fine tune the L P G content, depending on the type of, uh, of F A P enzyme that is using the microbial cell factory now. Previously, I had mentioned that most of our prototype work has been done in, uh, in E. Coli. But really, we need to translate that into, uh, into a more robust, um, robust industrial hosts. So confidential fermentation czar. Clearly very costly, both in terms of Capex investments and ongoing OPEC's training costs. Um, fermentation typically uses extensive, expensive steel fermenters with monitoring systems. It requires aeration mixing and DSP sterilization costs and, of course, extensive use of fresh fresh water water. So we have a strong collaboration with George Kennan, Qinghua University in Beijing, and George is the sort of world leader in terms of using extremophiles or halo files as hosts for next generation by technology. And we worked with George in recent years to, uh if you like, translate much of our chemicals pathways into Halo Philly coasts. And the beauty of that is that hey, Lemonis can use low cost reactors. We don't need sterilization because the high slanting the gates sterilization processes these strains will grow in seawater. They will use simple waste carbon sources as growth feedstocks. They're genetically tractable, And, uh, it's already demonstrated to be in an existing robust industrial host. So our only lab scale work looked at propane production with both clean and crude biodiesel media. You can see that on the slide, and we've been able to show production of propane in hello Mona, as indicated in the top right hand panel. And what's more, if the very intense times are introducing to, uh, this is just a further a further description of what I've just described here you can see the performance here is actually much improved above what we see using our E. Coli host, I published propane levels of around about 0.2 g per liter of culture. Hey, Lemonis has got a high tolerance to the substrate we use for this photo Catalytic conversion. We can get growth in non sterile seawater, uh, and so on and so forth. All the characteristics that you'd want to see beginning to emerge out of this this new, this new platform talk. What's more, we can if we place the very intense times into a photosynthetic organisms such as cynic assistance, we can also demonstrate propane production from seo 2 ft stocks. This therefore opens up the exciting possibility of making gazing. Hydrocarbon fuels from CO two is the titles in this case, although than what we're seeing. Helen bonuses clearly rounds of optimization to be done here. But again, we establish an important proof of proof of concept for further development of making fuels from co two. So what I hope I've done is to give you a flavor of the type of trajectory with that we're pursuing both academically and in our open access sort of, uh, commercial ventures. Uh, the sort of work that we're doing clearly is much more happening that's commercially sensitive in the company that I can't talk about today. But what we have done is to demonstrate proof of concept for bio LPG production. Using engineered the microbial cell factories, we've performed technical economics and L c A. To inform route to scale production based on these foundational strains. And C three biotech is now engaged in experimental pilot plant developments to guide scale up and to feed back into further iterations of strain engineering, uh, to ultimately impact on the economics and productivity of production. I'm conscious that I've probably gone over my time slightly, So I I think that is where I will finish. But before I do that, I'd like to finish by really thanking many researchers have contributed to the research process I've discussed today funding from various agencies. In particular. I'd like to thank the staff in Symbiotic M Center at Manchester who have done a lot of the strain automation of the strain engineering. But also in the future be Rh, which is a second center that Steve risking much of the scale at work and then people in my own research group who have really pushed the L P G type work but also important collaborators. We've worked with Patrick Jones at Imperial College on this project in the early stages and and indeed in some of the civic assistance work and also my good collaborator in Beijing, George Chen, with whom we've been doing much of the work with one halem owners. Funders are, of course, u K R I. But increasingly, we have industry funded programs coming from C three biotech. That's where I'll finish. And I'm certainly happy to take any questions if people have them. Thank you. Um, thank you very much. Like a little for a really excellent talk, really thought provoking talk as well, Especially for me, who's more sort of inorganic engineer than than bio? Really fascinating. We do have a couple of questions already popping up on the questions. Um, Maria asks or says. It's an amazing example of targeted engineering of nature, but you'd like to know about the economical viability of the process, the estimation of such price of the price of such product, and you need to purify you to listen to the sea and what's the most expensive? The DBT L cycle? Yeah, okay. Both of those are excellent questions. We've done quite a lot of early stage technical economic analysis, particularly the bio LPG, and you can imagine that we've got a real challenge. L P G is not that expensive. Uh, so to have a process that's competitive with existing manufacturing processes is is going to be, uh, a significant challenge. The answer here, I think, is a micro microbial cell factory. Just making propane alone or making LPG alone. He's not. He's not going to compete with cost, but the way forward, I think, is to take a more integrated by refinery type approach. But Symbian Fi, that approach, what I mean by that is to take your chassis that makes LPG and also having to make multiple other products. We've looked at that in detail in our published paper that came out earlier this year, where we've got different case scenarios. We've done the technical economics and the L C A and other types of approach for up to 10 or 11 different case studies and as you follow through this case, studies that you can see that you can really bring the cost of manufacture down to the point where it becomes, in our view, economically viable proposition. That's the approach we're taking in the company. And and also the approach has been used to feed back into further engineering of the strains. Mhm. The second part, the question, I think, was to do with the rate limiting step in DBT l was the what was the most expensive step in the DBT. Gosh, I think the most expensive step is staff resource. If I'm brutally honest and Capital Investment is setting up the platform in terms of consumable running costs, I think that's really hard to de construct. I I think, uh, you know, as you can imagine, a platform of this type takes a lot of expensive equipment and just running and maintain multiple mass spectrometers. Robotics so on and so forth is a constant manager's nightmare in terms of finally money to make sure that that is kept up and working. So actually, I think that's where the real the real cost is that and staff resource, um, consumable costs, uh, time, um, perhaps less so. Do you hope that answers your question. Maria Stephen Wallace would like to ask, um, thank you for a great talk and says he was just wondering how photo active you're the car box lays is when it's inside the cell and also inside a fermenter. Yeah, that's a really good question, too, because you know the challenge we have with any photo active system is like penetration into the cells. Uh, and that's going to be an engineering challenge Moving forward. We're aware of that. We've done some scoping experiments, a lab scale to try and try and tackle with that, certainly in a lab scale. Fermenter when? Later. Half a liter. We can We can show that we can drive the reaction in life cells. Uh, the problem. Working with the photo bio catalyst is that in the excited state, the enzyme is pretty unstable. The chemistry is reactive chemistry, so actually, your enzyme undergoes inactivation pretty quickly, even in a life cell. So you have to constantly generate your your biomass to recover the catalyst. It's a bit like you do in the chemical industry. You make a catalyst. It gets poisoned, going to remake it. The good thing about biology is remaking that catalyst is not that expensive. You just regrow the box. So there are a number of issues we have to we have to deal with here. Like penetration is warm. We're generating catalyst as the other. Thank you. Um, and Stephen also asks, What do you think the future role of traditional synthetic chemists will be a strain? Engineering becomes more and more routine than we gradually move away from petrochemicals. Well, be careful what I say here. You can probably tell by I'm passionate about you know, what the role for bio founders is. Where it's complementary to what we what we achieve using conventional synthetic approaches. They'll always be chemistry that biology can't do. But there might also be chemistry and biology. Do that Chemistry can't do so. You know, I I really see this as a twin track approach. Really? Uh, getting a closer time to developing, uh, programs or processes in which synthetic biology is part of the is part of the journey I think is an important thing. Let me give you an example. Synthetic biology is really good at making carbon scaffold. As I showed you today. Turpin scaffolds Taylor in the scaffolds through very precise Oxy functional ization or further editions might either be a synthetic chemistry challenge. Or it might be a sort of wholesale or purified bike analysis type, the sort of things we do in the U. K bike analysis sort of theme of the palaces heart. So I don't think any of these things are exclusive. They have to be integrated as part of a sort of hybrid work stream moving forward. But I think symbiote can certainly make scaffolds very effectively and cheaply. If that answers your question. Stephen um, Coolest six grands Karen. Sorry. Pronounce that really badly, I'm sure asks, Did you manage to express difficult to express membrane bound cytochrome P 4 50 enzymes and E. Coli, which are part of these processes? So we stayed away from membrane bound sort of Mormon alien type UK Arctic P four fifties Uh, and we, uh, and everyone knows who works on P four fifties that working with membrane bound systems is a bit of a nightmare and in fact, probably one of the reasons why P four fifties are not widely exploited in in conventional industrial black analysis, we tend to concentrate on mutant variant forms of bacterial systems. You well characterized people 50 can people to be m three, those sort of enzymes. There are many variants now available from labs all over the world, and that's the That's the sort of repository of enzymes that we used for the basis of that work. Um, having said that, we were able to find catalysts that could really oxy functionally all different positions of the Turpin's that we that we discussed. And Bill Stubs would like to know. Is there a market for bio based short chain fatty acids? I'd like to know that for obvious reasons. And if anyone knows the market for short chain, smelly, volatile acids, then please let me know. Drop me an email. I'd be delighted to hear from you. I'm sure there is, but I don't quite know the details of that. So if anyone's got any insight, please let me know. Okay. You and McDonnell would like thank you for the talk and ask. Um, is there a place for multi species strain communities with bacteria to improve stability, act in synergy and mitigate species, strain specific weaknesses for large scale fermentation bio services as opposed to stringer. Singular strains such as the DBT cycles. I think the answer to that is yes. Very likely. Very probably for a variety of reasons. Shuttling intermediates out of one. Uh, first of all, getting a complex metabolic pathway to work in a single host is probably quite difficult. Uh, a real challenge in terms of the engineering and biology you have to do. Making two smaller strains that communicate with each other to perhaps share the problems with one as a substrate for another is an obvious strategy. There are many other strategies that might require to work with multiple organisms. So, in short, yes. Uh, I could probably talk for another half hour on the sort of application areas where that might be the case. I probably not appropriate for today, but certainly yes, I think multi multi cultures are are certainly on the cards. Okay. Um, Mohammad Javad would like to know. Just r Turpin is produced in the engineered E. Coli with growth, or is it produced as a secondary metabolic light in the stationary phase? The program? Yeah. I don't have hard data to show you on that, but certainly in the early stages of growth. A lot of the strategy using the ladder are classical. Sort of what? The molecular biologist wouldn't get your biomass up and then induce, uh, and switch on your your chemistry? Uh, yeah, I think at an academic level, that's what we would do. So you tend to sort of get production toward the end of the growth cycle when you're approaching station phase Clearly anymore, industrial context. When you don't want to be using induce double promoters, you might be working off more constitutive promoters that don't require induction. You might have a different regime. Many of these compounds, however, cited toxic. So you've also got to get that balance right as well. You don't want to make it too early so that you you start interfering with your biomass accumulation. So it's a bit of a fine balancing act if I'm honest and we're exploring many of those, uh, different regimes in some of the scaling work that we're doing, he does ask what is the yield, Grandpa, Grandpa, Grandpa, Grandma substrate. I do well again, which probably you're talking about. So I I don't have that data for for the Turpin prototype pathways, uh, mainly because we haven't determined that accurately. I think these are prototypes, trains, the ones I talked about today we have to go through optimization processes before we start looking. Stop kilometers of conversion. We have done that sort of work for our LPG work. I'm not sure I want to sort of share some of that data with at this stage because there's some commercial sensitivity. But we have done some of that work with some of our adapted strains. We have an anonymous question which is, Will such synthetic biology synthesized substances get rejected by the public in the same manner as GMOs? So how can we convince? People say, Well, the hope is not. The lesson has to be learned. And of course, when synthetic biology research councils and another funding came into this from the government injection in 2014, 13, then that was clearly very much on the agenda. And research councils quite rightly were determined that that conversation should happen early on so that we could de risk the acceptability of the engineering that we're doing, uh, within the centers. So in the Manchester Center, we we have great leadership in this space from someone called Phil Shapira, who has driven really quite a lot of the, uh, responsible research innovation work in the center and and offered some leadership nationally in that as well, uh, we hope that those sort of conversations will well prevent another GMO situation backfiring on the on the symbiote world. Um, thank you, Chris Newman. Thank you for your talk and asks, How far away are you from a commercial production of a monitor? 13. I can't tell you that. I'm afraid. Too sensitive. Watch this space. Sorry, Chris. The winner Froth asks. Um, so he's a biochemistry in to get to it and was wondering what skills you would encourage for him to learn. If you wanted to get involved in bio engineering. That's a tough one. And I think, you know, there's a lot of skills. I mean, it really, truly is an interdisciplinary, uh, challenge. And it's exciting for PG students who want to sort of work in this space. But, you know, you really have to sort of be agile, and you've got to be prepared to sort of jump in at the deep end. I mean, I I know I trained as an entomologist all right. You know, I don't know where I am these days, and some, some would say, a jack of all trades master of none. That's probably quite right, because, you know, we dabble in so much different stuff, and I think you have to do is a synthetic biology. You have to do some of the, you know, sort of computational design work. You've got to do the analytical chemistry strain engineering, the underpinning molecular biology. There's lots of conventional chemistry involved as well. It's a big arctic for any anybody training. So I would say, you know, look around at the training opportunities that you have. We think we do pretty well in the mid, and I'm sure the centers do it equally well, it's just that, you know, you need to find that sort of environment that supports it. Yeah, mhm. Um, there were there. Was understood from Chris Newman. Govind Arrow. Sorry. Gavin says hello. Minas is indeed a good host for Ph. B. Was further path. Was the pathway further engineered for diverting flux from P h B two propane. Also. Sorry I missed how you store the propane in a lab environment. Thank you. So I can't tell you anything about the details of the engineering, because again there's there's sensitivities, I'm afraid in that process. I apologize for not being able to sort of give details. Ah, recovering. Probing from lifestyle Barry actors is relatively straightforward, of course, is the gas. So you don't have the same problem you have with other biofuels which are either stuck in the cell or stuck in the liquid of the reactor. It comes off as a gas, so you can just do a simple liquefaction. Uh, it's standard technology in the propane industry. My business partner is in the propane industry. He knows how to do that. So we have an instant network of expertise that we can drawn to help us do it. Okay. And you already asks, um, is there any opportunity to make more valuable bioproducts upstream from Pope propane, for example, Acrylic acid in principle? Yes, Uh, you know, as academics, of course, we're looking to derive value from existing pathways that we have in our center symbiotic, um, and indeed, in future P. R. H. A lot of the sort of initial pathways that we developed. We're looking to derive value from them. But we call them our gateway pathways because they open up, then routes to other close by chemicals of value. So we've done this recently. Flavonoids, for example. Our initial entry pathway there was elaborated further to make you know different types of flavonoids. So, yes, in principle, absolutely. There's always that opportunity. And it's relatively straightforward to do that. Well, I think you can tell from the width of the questioning it was a very well received talk. I think we've come to the end of the questions now. I'm sure all the participants are clapping at their screens and saying Thank you very much for such an inspiring talk. And I'd like to say Thank you very much for giving up your time to give us this talk. It's been excellent. Thank you very much. It's been a pleasure. I've enjoyed it. And I hope people have got something to take away with them. So thank you very much for inviting me. Thank you very much. Goodbye, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I hope to see you next month for our next Webinar. And lots of thanks on the chat. Okay. I will end the meeting. The reporting on the website once it's been processed. Okay, Thanks. Bye. Yeah,\""

              "\"welcome everyone to the October installment of the task of Webinar series. it's my very great pleasure to introduce fresh Nigel Stratton from the Manchester Institute of Biotechnology in Manchester University, who will be talking about microbial cell factor factories. Sorry, I've lost my ability to read, an engineering biology for chemical production. I will hand straight over tonight, all but if you could use the Q and A function to ask questions and we will answer all the questions at the end. Do you have any technical difficulties or any issues or would like to introduce yourself and let us know where you're from? Please use the chat button. on on that, I will hand straight over to Professor Scrutton. Okay, Thank you very much. Thanks. Very, very kind introduction. It's a pleasure to be with you all this afternoon and for me to be able to tell you about our recent work on engineering biology for chemicals production and by manufacturing. So what I'd like to do today is to discuss our work on establish establishing an automated by a foundry for microbial strain engineering and the impact that this is having on chemicals and fuels production, and then how some of this work is now being translated to scale for the commercial production of selected advanced fuels. Mhm. So we're just to provide some context, of course, by manufacturing is a significant contributor to the UK economy and we're now on the cusp. I think of rapid expansion of this sector as we urgently try to find solutions to meet global challenges, for example, the government's clean growth and zero carbon agendas. This is especially important, I think, in the UK chemicals manufacturing sector, which includes over 3000 businesses employing around about 100 and 53,000 people and giving something like 19 billion in gross value added to a turnover around about 55 billion. So, of course, the majority of this comes from petrochemicals. The fact that's increasingly odds with the Paris Agreement obligations and 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. So clearly and urgently, we need to change and transition to a more sustainable by manufacturing sector. That's part of the UK's economic recovery as we build back better following the global pandemic. Now, of course, the U. K is recognized as a world leader in biotechnology. And,this is especially true in the research base, which delivers first rate discovery science.huh. The UK, however, needs to do better at building back from this science based to implement sustainable by manufacturing technologies and bring them to market. And I guess pre pandemic. The UK produced multiple roadmaps, many of them you see on the slide here and vision documents to shape future investment in infrastructure training and science and technology programmes to rapidly grow the industrial biotechnology base. And so I guess there's no better time than now to capitalize on these developments, especially as we approach the next U. N Climate change conference in Glasgow in 2021 as we aim to build back better through clean growth. So what I hope to convince you of this afternoon is that the vibe or the Manchester instituted by technology, we're developing a research environment to tackle the science and technology challenges of establishing a bio based manufacturing economy, especially in the areas of fuels and chemicals. And over the years, it has assembled a strong interdisciplinary research community working together across the biology, chemistry, materials, engineering and competition, all science areas that it really has enabled us to address ambitious challenge led research programs. And of course, we were delighted to be recognized earlier this year through the award of the Queen's anniversary prize. Recognizing MIB leadership in the UK's strategic development of biotechnology and by manufacturing through innovative technologies and partnerships with industry now in what we've done is to assemble a number of capability platforms that have often been supported by major investments from you Care I and industry. And these are provided focal points for the development of new technology platforms for engineering biology and for forming interactions with external groups and industry to help pull through academic discoveries towards industrial application. What I want to do today is focus on two key research areas. Synthetic biology and bike analysis, but also supported by work we've been doing in the structural and biophysics analysis of enzyme systems. So in 2014, we established symbol became one of the six synthetic biology research centres supported by the B B S. R. C as a platform center for the rapid engineering of microbial strains for fine and specialty chemicals based on a bespoke design built Tesla and platform that we've developed within the center. The chemicals production pipeline starts at the design stage shown in purple here, where we set out blueprints for engineered microbial strains using a suite of design algorithms for rapid strain engineering. These include design tools for retros, emphasis in the cell and the design of extended metabolic pathways to access new chemical space and enzyme selection and engineering tools. We can then design and select DNA parts, combine them into a plasmid libraries using automated assembly instructions and high throughput robotics and the built stage, then prepares us for the assembly of these genetically encoded parts and assembles them into plasmids via, for example, like cycling reactions according to automatically generated work lists that drive the laboratory automation and the fidelity of assemble pathways is then checked, for example, by high throughput restriction analysis and capillary electrophoresis, or by Nana for DNA sequencing. And then the test stage encompasses hide throughput methods for the growth of microbial production cultures, automated product extraction and screening via fast liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. The results are analyzed in the loan stage of the blue shaded panel on the slide through predictive models using statistical methods of machine learning to inform the next round of design and after a number of iterations of this DBT l cycle, successful prototypes are then taken forward to process development and scale up. And so, in establishing the symbiotic pipeline, we set out really to achieve a number of objectives. First of all, the pipeline should be agnostic to the target compound that we want to produce and also, to certain extent to the host bacterial organism so that we can support the production of many different chemicals from different host organisms. Secondly, it should leverage high throughput automation to ensure rapid delivery of new strains, and this improved performance should also reduce human error in the engineering programs. Third, we set out to provide software, platforms and expertise that could then be readily adopted by the wider synthetic biology community. Development of the symbiotic by founder concept was really phased in phase one that we focus very much on developing the underpinning capabilities of the pipeline around three target groups of compounds. There's been flavonoids, Turpin's and alkaloids example of groups, and then in the second phase, we then tested the pipeline in anger, carrying out a stress test to determine how many materials modern is, for example, that we could produce from biology in a three month window using the symbiotic capabilities. So in the first stress test, we set ourselves the challenge of seeing how many materials modern as we could produce by engineering E. Coli Using the pipeline and in discussions with local material scientists at Manchester, we identified a list of monomer targets used widely by industry, and a selection of these targets from the list was chosen based on monomers that were either found in natural bio synthesis routes or ones that are by synthetic by synthetically accessible, based on literature, information and perspective by a retro synthetic research, we selected 25 targets encompassing seven compound classes that were either materials, monitors or compound precursors. These encompassed vinyl, benzene, xylene, benzene, mandalay, Tsai's a beautiful compounds, dials, dines and dark, a box fillets, each with our own application areas in polymer chemistry. We then set ourselves a notional 90 day limit to walk through the design, build test and learn cycle to identify how many unique strains capable of synthesizing these products could be engineered, but also to characterize general properties such as the titles of products in laboratory fermentation and to identify potential strains that could enter a second DBT L cycle. Focus this time on optimizing Titus to reach graham polluter levels suitable for large scale production. So for each class of chemical target, new synthetic metabolic pathways were selected following the symbiotic, an automated approach which involves the use of retro synthesis software enzyme candidates for each step were selected using our design algorithm, cell enzyme and via file, a genetic analysis and the target compounds and primary tab. A light precursors are represented here by skeletal formula, whilst other E. Coli metabolites are represented by abbreviations. Now, the continuous arrows on the on the slide represents single enzyme step, whereas successive barriers represent multiple enzymatic transformations towards the target compound. So target successfully produced. A new coal is shown in green. Those in red were from the original target list, but for which enzymatic routes to their production were not found. Orange targets were produced enigmatically in vitro, but not during fermentation of E. Coli, and the blue structures identified compounds in which the title was raised substantially by engineering E. Coli, for example, by knocking out competing pathways or by boosting expression of bio catalysts in the cell through further rounds of strain engineering. The entire DB TL engineering cycle was completed in automated fashion within 85 days. The success of the rapid design and engineering of new bacterial strange reveals the power we believe of the prototyping strategy of the bio foundry approach and discovering new pathways that can lead to chemical space not naturally found in biology. We subsequently took a small selection of these strains that have been engineered to produce Mandel eight and Hydroxy Mandel eight and put them through a second stress test with the objective of increasing Titus to the Grand Pelita scale. That second stress test was likewise successful driving titles into the 1 to 10 g per liter scale values that are now suitable for consideration of production scale up for these compounds. So if we look at the outcome of the stress test is a simple numbers gallery, we can get a feel for the capabilities of the construct of pipeline within the 85 day limit. We designed and created 160 unique genetic parts by DNA synthesis. We constructed them verified by sequencing 187 unique pathway constructs assembled. Using our automated like cycling reaction methods, we performed over 150 unique enzyme assays created nine mutant E. Coli chassis is using, for example, genome engineering methods that we analyze more than 8000 samples using mass spectrometry as part of the integrated test platform, and we developed 22 new mess quantification methods. The outcome is that from a standing a standing starting point, we create a prototype strains for 17 out of the original 25 monomers of interest, and we were able to access biologically five out of seven classes of identified monomer types. So overall, we estimate that the personnel and consumable costs amounted to around about £15,000 per successful target, corresponding to 360 personnel hours compound. And this rigorous and comprehensive benchmarking study we feel now showcases the ability of Bali founder is to provide quick and affordable access to a diverse range of chemicals by microbial fermentation and how these early prototype strains can now be optimized and scaled up to achieve. Graham pleaded fermentation as a basis for large scale production, so we've also been interested in exploring biological diversity and chemical diversity using the bio foundry approach. And for some time now we've been exploring Turpin chemistry as an attractive playground for microbial chemicals production, as the Turpin's group is naturally very diverse, with up to around about 80 known compounds in nature. In the interests of focusing on the subset of these compounds, we concentrated on the monitor pins, which are C 10 compounds. Made from the eyes open are precursors isa fentanyl, die phosphate and dimethyl ala di phosphate. Now, many of these monitor peons have major industrial applications and are used widely, for example, as flavorings, fragrances and antiseptics. There are also important precursors for pharmaceuticals, bio plastics and fuels. Currently, they are obtained from either agricultural sources, which are subject to seasonal variation, crop yields and use land that, frankly, could be better repurpose for, for example, for producing food or their synthesized chemically, which in itself is a challenge, given their overall complex structures and the existence of multiple stereo centers. And this drives up the cost of production and purification of the desired products. So we set out to discover if compounds of this type could be made readily using synthetic biology and to create a plug and play microbial prototype strain that could produce a vast array of Turpin's. And, if successful with an interested to see is selected, strains could be optimized further to support production at scale. So during the early development phases of the symbiote can pipeline, we focused on three chemical groups. As I said previously, Turpin's Flavonoids and Alkaloids, our first demonstration of the pipeline with flavonoids alkaloids, was published in 2018 prior to the material stress test that I mentioned earlier. The Turpin work has been progressing over an extended timeline to build up a series of strange and genetically encoded parts to make a vast array of Turpin's in engineered microbial strains, some of which are currently being scaled for specific applications with with industry partners. And again, what I hope to do is to convince you that the Bio Founder is and the engineering of biology provide attractive alternative routes to the production of a range of industrial important chemicals and also potentially expand the chemical reach beyond that easily attainable using synthetic chemistry methods. So on this line, I call this,image,monitor pinwheel. It indicates the skeletal structures of all monitor pin scaffolds derived from the precursor as a paranoid shown at the bottom of the the bottom of the wheel shown here, we can identify three subgroups. The Bice I click monitor pins, the motorcycling and the A cyclic monitor pins. Under objective was to engineer prototype strains that can make each of these compounds as a basis for further optimization and ultimately scale up for production. The first task was to engineer the feeder pathway that gives rise to a common substrates For all these Turpin's that's journal de Phosphate. We and others have created such pathways using variants of the so called endogenous MPP pathways, which generally results in low interest in the levels of the ISA paranoid precursors or using a hydrologist envy, a pathway that we have created an optimist in recent years to balance carbon flux and stability when contained in a tetralogy is host. After synthesizing these pathways for progressive supply, our objective was then to introduce a library of monitor ping psych lasers into the host train, using a plug and play approach to switch on the synthesis of the desired monetary cream product. Now, initially, we targeted 2 to 3 non plant Turpin cycles is for each individual scaffold, taken from a diverse source of a diverse source of different plants and the hope of detecting and quantifying the monitor PM product produced from the engineers' trains. This then opens up additional D PTL engineering, for example, to optimize product. Titus minimize cited toxicity of the products and enable tailoring of the scaffolds to make higher higher value products. So early designs were relatively straightforward. We set up a two plasmid system with the feeder pathways contained in a single place. We've shown here,and with a second plastic containing journal de phosphate, the entry enzyme that is required to form a G D. P, on which the Turpin cyclists can then act switching in and out of different Turpin cyclers enzymes that enables production of different target monitor paeans to be studied. The to feed the pathways were engineered and optimize using enzymes taken from multiple organisms. Color coded has shown shown here, and fine tuning of metabolic flux through this engineered of a pathway was also achieved through machine learning to affect translational tuning of individual genes using libraries, synthetic rubbers on binding sites to boost production Titus by over 60% when screening under 3% of arrivals on binding site library MM to facilitate library screening, a multi well plate fermentation procedure was developed, allowing increased screening throughout throughput with sufficient resolution to discriminate between high and low producers. This early optimization has helped to balance the flux through the NVA pathway, when coupled with further engineering, has led to the production of stable and optimist plastic constructs for the production of the required ISA paranoid precursors. So what we have achieved is the creation of a first generation library of E. Coli strains that can make every natural monitor being scaffold represented in the so called monitor P wheel. This then gives us access to a generalist platform of E. Coli strains as a starting point for optimization for scale up and also for further chemical tailoring and to facilitate tailing. And we also generated an extensive bike analysis toolkit for the oxy functional ization of Turpin's. By designing and building a cytochrome P 4 50 enzyme collection and testing it in a custom made untargeted GCMS met economics based approach, we're able to rapidly create and characteristics a comprehensive library for the controlled oxy functional ization of Turpin scaffold with a wide range of activities and selectivity, is towards all the monitor being shown here. We can now use this novel by cattle IT resource to access the extensive chemical diversity of Turpin Lloyds by further pathway engineering through the assembly of by catalytic cascades to subsequently produced libraries of oxygenated Turpin roids and their derivatives for diverse applications, for example, Turpin based drug discovery. So the outcome of the first generation engineering is shown here, both in terms of product profiles and indeed, titles achieved for each of them all Turpin scaffold. We were able to produce more than 30 different monitor paranoids from glucose using 20 different Turpin synthesizers. Several novel scaffolds were generated not previously produced in engineered microbes before, and initial production levels were exceeded for most. Where selected examples have been previously produced and engineered microbes, most Turpin synthesis how they produced multiple products and in particular complex bys. I click products where typically only 60 to 70% of the total Turpin product is of the bicycling type. Some compounds are produced at very low titles, as we can see here, and examples include targets that we were particularly interested in Little Lulu. And finally, what is striking overall is that the product profile profiles were generally very complex and multiple products were obtained with most psych lasers or Turpin synthesizers, and a range of product titles were obtained. These were affected by many things. Optimizing the pathway flux, enzyme expression, minimizing side product formation and controlling the effects of sight of toxicity are all important factors in determining the final title obtained. Moreover, engineering individual Turpin synthesizers or finding alternative catalysts in native to give cleaner products is clearly a priority for large scale production of these compounds. Now, the reasons for the complex product profiles have found really in the mechanistic details of the mode of action of Turpin synthesis. These enzymes initiate the reaction cascade by eliminating the dye phosphate of journal Die Phosphates and on the left here to form the journal. Katyn has also shown here on the second the second structure on the slide. This then undergoes I summarization to form the Little Island terminal captains at any point along the reaction Cade cascade. These reactive enzyme intermediates can undergo further chemical reactions such as inter molecular attack on all offending double bombs, hydride or protein migrations and rearrangements to change the structure of the chemical staff. Scaffold. Ultimately, the reactive intermediates to quench by deep rooted nation or nuclear filic. Attack by water now hydrophobic residues in the enzyme active site for this rather oily substrate binding pocket. I make the comparison here with an ice cream scoop and that we can mold the active site. But we really give it little chemical identity to specifically position the substrate in the active site. This hydrophobic binding pocket protects the Qatar nick intermediates from the undirected attack of water and aromatic residues stabilised the charged intermediates by Qatar and pie interactions. Now these relatively inert active sites means it's very. There's very little overall sequence similarity between different Turpin psych lasers, with the exception of small finger printer Sparta rich sequence motifs close,and and and the second short motif, which is involved in binding the magnesium co factors. This lack of overall sequence identity really complicates any attempt at rational design of the of these enzymes, season structure and sequence guided protein engineering. And this is clearly a problem when one has the objective to really tighten up product profiles, for example, for the production of the clean products in our microbial cell factories. this is a major engineering challenge for this particular field. So given the complex product profiles obtained with many of the natural plant Turpin synthesis, more recently we switched our attention to mining Turpin synthesis from bacterial species. And given the poor sequence conservation in the active site, we used a hidden Markov model in thematic search of bacterial genome sequences to identify new Turpin, cyclers and enzymes. Using this approach, we've identified 2867 punitive new bacterial Turpin synthesis using the two finger print motifs I discussed briefly on the previous slide. And then we select a multiple examples and characterize their overall activity using, for example, GCMs type analysis. Most were shown to be Cesc utopian and dystopian synthesis, and only a few were shown to be monitor prion synthesis. That said, we have identified specific line Alou and serial Turpin synthesis we've got on to determine their X ray structures and product profiles and showing these are in fact, far superior as catalysts for producing those compounds in microbial cell factories compared to the plant enzymes. So we've shown that the bacterial enzymes are simpler instruction. more importantly, given much more restrictive product profiles, as I say, the bacterial signal and linear altarpieces. Since this does not only give cleaner product profiles but predominantly form a single product in lifestyle fermentation, it also enables much higher Titus to be reached for these particular products in our plug and play platform. And this then enables us to begin to consider whether we can scale up some of these prototypes strains to produce these compounds that ground per liter levels. Okay, so what I hope I've done so far is to show that the by foundry approach is certainly useful and rapidly generating prototypical strains. There can be then further optimized for large scale fermentation, but also give you access to chemistry that may be difficult to access using conventional synthetic methods,and therefore that really demonstrates the power of biology in rapidly generating a palliative like of different chemical structures from a common from a common scaffold. What I'd like to do now is to change tack a little bit and show you how microbial cell factory engineering can also be used to make fuels from biology. We've worked for the last seven or eight years and continue to do so on a production of liquefied petroleum gas, or LPG, from engineered microbial strains using fermented and photo catalytic processes. This is a story that's gone from early strain development to large scale production of bio LPGA pilots demonstrated scale and, in recent years, the establishment of a field from biology company called C three biotech that we established, which is currently scaling and commercializing our bio LPG production technologies. So the obvious question, first of all, is why target LPG? Well, first of all, it's important to appreciate the L. P. G varies across the world, predominantly comprises propane, but there are varying amounts of butane and other combustible gases present depending on where you source the gas globally in the U. K L. P. G. Is almost entirely propane in composition and its manufacturer is is clearly from fossil sources. Now L. P G is a very clean burning transport fuel, currently around about 22 million tons per annum, and it holds an important position in domestic heating markets used in about 40 million homes worldwide is also used extensively in cooking as a non greenhouse gas refrigerant and also as an aerosol propellant. There are commercial technologies out there. Yesterday, for example, developed an energy intensive chemical process for conversion of bio based glycerol. Two propane. But as yet a true biological roots to LPG has not yet been commercialized. Now L. P G is an excellent fuel. There are low energy costs required for its liquefaction. It's easily transported, and it's a non greenhouse gas, and therefore it compares favorably to other alkaline gas fuels such as methane, which is a major greenhouse gas produced from traditional anaerobic digestion plants. So all this combines to make L. P G. I think, an attractive target for production using microbial cell factories. And that's the journey that we set out to to to follow over the last seven or 87 or eight years. Now, in thinking about this, I actually think it's worth really reflecting on what is the end product. What do we want to achieve here so that we can begin to think about how we can design the biology to fit fit the end game as it were? So this is my forward thinking slide. We need to ask what a bio LPG production plant might look like on the long term so that the engineering and process characteristics and overall economics of setting up and running such a plant could be fed back into early stage microbial strain engineering. To ensure that the biology is aligned with the larger scale engineering challenges. Consequent, we've taken a bottom up systems engineering approach to inform the overall design clearly feedstock supplies central. We need to be able to target, for example, carbon dioxide or industrial wastes, or perhaps agriculture on food and biomass waste, which are in plentiful supply in the UK We shouldn't be reliant on freshwater, which is potentially scarce in certain regions of the world and also adds an initial cost burden in terms of the operation of such a plant. So our process is, therefore need to run on seawater or brackish water. We want to use them out in the field we need to obtain, we need to we need to be clean and carbon mutual bio RPGs have explained, is a clean burning fuel and distributed manufacturer for local use would certainly minimize transportation costs and further carbon burden We also require simple downstream processing to mitigate against major costs. So by embedding production into the existing infrastructures for production transport, we essentially have a drop in solution. We need to tailor to different waste streams so we can be used effectively across the globe. And there needs to be a low Capex and OPEC's burden across the supply chain for its production, use and transport. So these are the sort of guiding principles that there were clearly thinking about in terms of developing a biological process for LPG production. So let's return to the basic science.first of all, we need to develop a biological route to propane. Propane is not produced in nature, so there is no existing natural pathways or enzymes that can be repurposed for its scale for for large scale production. So our early inroads were therefore to design new metabolic pathways for its production and to source an engineer enzymes that could use a biologically sourced metabolite and turn that into propane gas. So, using the DBT L type principle, we created a new version of the cluster deal fermentation pathway to butin all but crucially adapted it to include newly discovered enzyme. Aldo Heidi Formulating our oxygen is or radios it's labeled, and you can see that in blue on the on the right hand panel at the bottom.and we set about to engineer this to work with short chain Aldo height substrates such as beautiful Aldo High. Our first target host was E. Coli because of ease and speed of genetic manipulation, as we've shown in the previous stress test with our material monitors, but with a view that any prototypical pathway discovered could then be transferred to a more robust industrial host that could be used effectively out in the field. So the general approach, the early approaches summarized here. We slept in a number of known by catalysts for each individual step in the conceptual metabolic pathways to propane and synthesizing DNA to encode these and assemble them into plasmid encoded pathways in the modular fashion. Using different plastic combinations, we then explore alternative routes along the pathway, as identified by the hatched shown here, as well as using bio catalyst supplied by nature. We also have to repurpose selector catalyst to improve the target chemistry, especially for the radio enzyme, which is a slow enzyme that works best with Long hair and Aldo hides. Having assembled these early pathways, we then set out to optimist by switching on and switching out new variants or by eliminating competing pathways through targeted knock out of jeans to ensure we direct metabolites to the desired product. Propane, so repurpose in a video by protein engineering was the first challenge. The enzyme works best with long chain alga heights. And to get a molecular view of this,how the substrate since we solve the crystal structure of radio in the presence of its surrogate ligand problematic acid, which coiffure purifies with the enzyme from E. Coli. And here you can see that the substrate accesses the active site through a long hydrophobic channel with a boxful group being presented to the Diane Center, which is the area,of Potala. Sis conjectured that hysteric blocking of this channel would exclude long chain substrates and perhaps favor the binding a short chain Alba High. So a number of single and multiple mutations were made the most effective being the replacement of residue. Alan E. 134 for Alan in. You can see that in the slide here you can see the red album side chain blocking off that channel, and the structure of that variant indicated the design intentions were carried it through in crystal structures with short urging substrates. We then introduced the the engineered enzymes into plastic constructs, where we had assembled parts of the pathway genes leading from the cell metabolite acetyl coa way through to the final product propane fermentation of a 12 hour period analytical skill that indicated that in fact, propane was now generated using this pathway, albeit in relatively small amounts. But despite the low Titus, this was the first Clostridium like fermentation pathway shown to produce propane gas and establishes an important proof of concept. The title is dependent on the metabolic route followed, as indicated by the red and the green bars. Beyond these proof of concept studies at lab scale, exploratory five and 400 liter scales have also been demonstrated, and the low tighter is clearly a challenge, in part due to the very low activity of radio. We've engaged in both directed evolution and rational engineering studies of video. But improvements in catalytic activity here are hard one and hindered by the fact that we still unsure what is limiting in the overall cabinet cycle of this intriguing enzyme. So on this slide you can visualize an airlift fermenter that we developed in C three Biotech, the spin out company to investigate early scale of challenges of appropriate production. Using the engineer coli strains that we produced, E. Coli is supported using glycerol from a re processing plant.from this movie, which I, I hope works on screen here, we just generate. I guess it might not work because I can't access my cursor. There it is from this movie here, you can hope. I'm not sure it's going to work. Ah, there it is. You can actually see a mixture of propane, another flammable gases burning from this early fermenter.there's propane in there. It's not entirely propane. It's a mixture of of other final gases as well. But this really does at least demonstrate a proof of concept that propane can produce. To some extent,in this larger scale,fermented. Yeah, there are challenges here. Clearly, this is not a system that we would want to scale at this at this stage. Because of the low titles produced, the cost of setting up sterile fermentation.we we with E. Coli and many of the engineering challenges that we set out. And in the end, we have decided that in fact, radio is probably not the ideal enzyme to the supporting short chain alcohol production in microbial cell factories. So armed with that knowledge that radios and like to support this large scale production in M. I B number of us in the institute have been looking at other potential enzymes that could give rise to vulnerable fuels.for example, we've had a M. I. B Y program on mechanism and structure of a number of enzymes, which can be used to produce Calkins al canes. And indeed, Turpin fuels that I've mentioned briefly. Some of those enzymes are shown here, but really, the game changer for us was the report in science in 2017 of a new photo enzyme isolated from algae, which using blue light and like a box of long chain fatty acids into short, too short chain al canes. So within that paper in science, the structure of the enzyme was reported by Sergei. It'll and it's provided the required insight into long chain fatty acid binding in the active site cliff that could be targeted for rational design towards substrates. The national Catholic cycle was also presented by these authors involving FD photo chemistry to Deco oxalate, the fatty acid, using excited state flavor in chemistry. And as part of the characterization of the enzyme, we've done further spectroscopic analyses of this particular catalyst to determine its overall reaction mechanism. These studies were reported recently in CSKA Talese's earlier this year Brief. We were able to demonstrate that Red Intermediate is formed even under the cryogenic conditions that is below the glass phase transition of proteins, implying that the chemical changes not dependent on larger scale protein motion. But the decay of that red intermediate is very much dependent on protein structural change because that only happens at temperatures above the glass phase transition. I won't dwell on those studies today. The paper is there if anyone's interested to follow up. We were also able using laser excitation experiments to look at proton transfer and hygiene transfer reactions associated with the formation decay of that red intermediate and were able to begin to deconstruct the overall reaction mechanism and proton transfer pathways and indeed identify key residues in the active site. And I pointed to the sustained residue assisting 432 that we showed is involved in formation decay of that particular red intermediate. What that means is that we've been able to advance now our understanding of the overall reaction mechanism. First of all, this concerns sister and residue is found in all fat monologues. F AP Hama logs are shown in the sequence alignment here, emphasizing its potential importance of the photo chemistry. That system is close to the FAA Deco factor, and we believe it gets involved in the chemistry through a series of hygiene transfer and electron transfer reactions. Essentially, what happens is that following Flavin excitation, we then get home Olympic vision of the carbon carbon bond on the substrate to form CO two, and Al came radical, and that arcane radical is then satisfied by H atom. Transfer from this active site sustain to form a violent radical species, which can translate form an interaction with the F D. That's the road intermediate and then relax back to the resting form of the enzyme. So armed with this knowledge, we now have a clearer understanding of mechanism, and this can be factored into rational engineering of the enzyme specificity. Our strategy is shown here, of course, in classical, anaerobic digestion, type processes or indeed, other processes derived from widely available biomass. You can get volatile fatty acids, streams. We can then think about Dick approximating those volatile fatty acids using a single enzymatic step using the photo Dick approximates to form propane, isa, butane and and beauty. So our overall strategy was to go in that particular direction. But of course, the fatty acid further decay Box Hill is predominantly works with long chain Aldo Heights. And our first challenge is really to try and re profile, if you like the specificity of that enzyme to work with with with shorter chain with short chain fatty acids, right?huh. So we created a series of,mutant constructs,informed by the structure.and you can see on this sequence,window here were able to identify residues which are involved in a redefining. If you like the substrate specificity of this enzyme. We've generated many variants of,FAP in an extensive media genesis cycle, some of single substitution. So there are multiple substitutions, but we've been able to sort of,if you like, I identify a sequence window where key changes can really alter the specificity of,of this enzyme for short chain for short chain, valuable, volatile fatty acids, and we can see some of the screening outputs here. So here we now have variants, which are able to work with both C three and C four hydrocarbon fatty acids and and indeed, C three C four hydrocarbon blends. That's important because wherever you are in the world, of course, L P G comprises propane, butane or other short chains. And you might want to fine tune the L P G content, depending on the type of,of F A P enzyme that is using the microbial cell factory now. Previously, I had mentioned that most of our prototype work has been done in,in E. Coli. But really, we need to translate that into,into a more robust, robust industrial hosts. So confidential fermentation czar. Clearly very costly, both in terms of Capex investments and ongoing OPEC's training costs. fermentation typically uses extensive, expensive steel fermenters with monitoring systems. It requires aeration mixing and DSP sterilization costs and, of course, extensive use of fresh fresh water water. So we have a strong collaboration with George Kennan, Qinghua University in Beijing, and George is the sort of world leader in terms of using extremophiles or halo files as hosts for next generation by technology. And we worked with George in recent years to,if you like, translate much of our chemicals pathways into Halo Philly coasts. And the beauty of that is that hey, Lemonis can use low cost reactors. We don't need sterilization because the high slanting the gates sterilization processes these strains will grow in seawater. They will use simple waste carbon sources as growth feedstocks. They're genetically tractable, And,it's already demonstrated to be in an existing robust industrial host. So our only lab scale work looked at propane production with both clean and crude biodiesel media. You can see that on the slide, and we've been able to show production of propane in hello Mona, as indicated in the top right hand panel. And what's more, if the very intense times are introducing to,this is just a further a further description of what I've just described here you can see the performance here is actually much improved above what we see using our E. Coli host, I published propane levels of around about 0.2 g per liter of culture. Hey, Lemonis has got a high tolerance to the substrate we use for this photo Catalytic conversion. We can get growth in non sterile seawater,and so on and so forth. All the characteristics that you'd want to see beginning to emerge out of this this new, this new platform talk. What's more, we can if we place the very intense times into a photosynthetic organisms such as cynic assistance, we can also demonstrate propane production from seo 2 ft stocks. This therefore opens up the exciting possibility of making gazing. Hydrocarbon fuels from CO two is the titles in this case, although than what we're seeing. Helen bonuses clearly rounds of optimization to be done here. But again, we establish an important proof of proof of concept for further development of making fuels from co two. So what I hope I've done is to give you a flavor of the type of trajectory with that we're pursuing both academically and in our open access sort of,commercial ventures.the sort of work that we're doing clearly is much more happening that's commercially sensitive in the company that I can't talk about today. But what we have done is to demonstrate proof of concept for bio LPG production. Using engineered the microbial cell factories, we've performed technical economics and L c A. To inform route to scale production based on these foundational strains. And C three biotech is now engaged in experimental pilot plant developments to guide scale up and to feed back into further iterations of strain engineering,to ultimately impact on the economics and productivity of production. I'm conscious that I've probably gone over my time slightly, So I I think that is where I will finish. But before I do that, I'd like to finish by really thanking many researchers have contributed to the research process I've discussed today funding from various agencies. In particular. I'd like to thank the staff in Symbiotic M Center at Manchester who have done a lot of the strain automation of the strain engineering. But also in the future be Rh, which is a second center that Steve risking much of the scale at work and then people in my own research group who have really pushed the L P G type work but also important collaborators. We've worked with Patrick Jones at Imperial College on this project in the early stages and and indeed in some of the civic assistance work and also my good collaborator in Beijing, George Chen, with whom we've been doing much of the work with one halem owners. Funders are, of course, u K R I. But increasingly, we have industry funded programs coming from C three biotech. That's where I'll finish. And I'm certainly happy to take any questions if people have them. Thank you. thank you very much. Like a little for a really excellent talk, really thought provoking talk as well, Especially for me, who's more sort of inorganic engineer than than bio? Really fascinating. We do have a couple of questions already popping up on the questions. Maria asks or says. It's an amazing example of targeted engineering of nature, but you'd like to know about the economical viability of the process, the estimation of such price of the price of such product, and you need to purify you to listen to the sea and what's the most expensive? The DBT L cycle? Yeah, okay. Both of those are excellent questions. We've done quite a lot of early stage technical economic analysis, particularly the bio LPG, and you can imagine that we've got a real challenge. L P G is not that expensive.so to have a process that's competitive with existing manufacturing processes is is going to be,a significant challenge. The answer here, I think, is a micro microbial cell factory. Just making propane alone or making LPG alone. He's not. He's not going to compete with cost, but the way forward, I think, is to take a more integrated by refinery type approach. But Symbian Fi, that approach, what I mean by that is to take your chassis that makes LPG and also having to make multiple other products. We've looked at that in detail in our published paper that came out earlier this year, where we've got different case scenarios. We've done the technical economics and the L C A and other types of approach for up to 10 or 11 different case studies and as you follow through this case, studies that you can see that you can really bring the cost of manufacture down to the point where it becomes, in our view, economically viable proposition. That's the approach we're taking in the company. And and also the approach has been used to feed back into further engineering of the strains. Mhm. The second part, the question, I think, was to do with the rate limiting step in DBT l was the what was the most expensive step in the DBT. Gosh, I think the most expensive step is staff resource. If I'm brutally honest and Capital Investment is setting up the platform in terms of consumable running costs, I think that's really hard to de construct. I I think,you know, as you can imagine, a platform of this type takes a lot of expensive equipment and just running and maintain multiple mass spectrometers. Robotics so on and so forth is a constant manager's nightmare in terms of finally money to make sure that that is kept up and working. So actually, I think that's where the real the real cost is that and staff resource, consumable costs,time, perhaps less so. Do you hope that answers your question. Maria Stephen Wallace would like to ask, thank you for a great talk and says he was just wondering how photo active you're the car box lays is when it's inside the cell and also inside a fermenter. Yeah, that's a really good question, too, because you know the challenge we have with any photo active system is like penetration into the cells.and that's going to be an engineering challenge Moving forward. We're aware of that. We've done some scoping experiments, a lab scale to try and try and tackle with that, certainly in a lab scale. Fermenter when? Later. Half a liter. We can We can show that we can drive the reaction in life cells.the problem. Working with the photo bio catalyst is that in the excited state, the enzyme is pretty unstable. The chemistry is reactive chemistry, so actually, your enzyme undergoes inactivation pretty quickly, even in a life cell. So you have to constantly generate your your biomass to recover the catalyst. It's a bit like you do in the chemical industry. You make a catalyst. It gets poisoned, going to remake it. The good thing about biology is remaking that catalyst is not that expensive. You just regrow the box. So there are a number of issues we have to we have to deal with here. Like penetration is warm. We're generating catalyst as the other. Thank you. and Stephen also asks, What do you think the future role of traditional synthetic chemists will be a strain? Engineering becomes more and more routine than we gradually move away from petrochemicals. Well, be careful what I say here. You can probably tell by I'm passionate about you know, what the role for bio founders is. Where it's complementary to what we what we achieve using conventional synthetic approaches. They'll always be chemistry that biology can't do. But there might also be chemistry and biology. Do that Chemistry can't do so. You know, I I really see this as a twin track approach. Really?getting a closer time to developing,programs or processes in which synthetic biology is part of the is part of the journey I think is an important thing. Let me give you an example. Synthetic biology is really good at making carbon scaffold. As I showed you today. Turpin scaffolds Taylor in the scaffolds through very precise Oxy functional ization or further editions might either be a synthetic chemistry challenge. Or it might be a sort of wholesale or purified bike analysis type, the sort of things we do in the U. K bike analysis sort of theme of the palaces heart. So I don't think any of these things are exclusive. They have to be integrated as part of a sort of hybrid work stream moving forward. But I think symbiote can certainly make scaffolds very effectively and cheaply. If that answers your question. Stephen Coolest six grands Karen. Sorry. Pronounce that really badly, I'm sure asks, Did you manage to express difficult to express membrane bound cytochrome P 4 50 enzymes and E. Coli, which are part of these processes? So we stayed away from membrane bound sort of Mormon alien type UK Arctic P four fiftiesand we,and everyone knows who works on P four fifties that working with membrane bound systems is a bit of a nightmare and in fact, probably one of the reasons why P four fifties are not widely exploited in in conventional industrial black analysis, we tend to concentrate on mutant variant forms of bacterial systems. You well characterized people 50 can people to be m three, those sort of enzymes. There are many variants now available from labs all over the world, and that's the That's the sort of repository of enzymes that we used for the basis of that work. having said that, we were able to find catalysts that could really oxy functionally all different positions of the Turpin's that we that we discussed. And Bill Stubs would like to know. Is there a market for bio based short chain fatty acids? I'd like to know that for obvious reasons. And if anyone knows the market for short chain, smelly, volatile acids, then please let me know. Drop me an email. I'd be delighted to hear from you. I'm sure there is, but I don't quite know the details of that. So if anyone's got any insight, please let me know. Okay. You and McDonnell would like thank you for the talk and ask. is there a place for multi species strain communities with bacteria to improve stability, act in synergy and mitigate species, strain specific weaknesses for large scale fermentation bio services as opposed to stringer. Singular strains such as the DBT cycles. I think the answer to that is yes. Very likely. Very probably for a variety of reasons. Shuttling intermediates out of one.first of all, getting a complex metabolic pathway to work in a single host is probably quite difficult.a real challenge in terms of the engineering and biology you have to do. Making two smaller strains that communicate with each other to perhaps share the problems with one as a substrate for another is an obvious strategy. There are many other strategies that might require to work with multiple organisms. So, in short, yes.I could probably talk for another half hour on the sort of application areas where that might be the case. I probably not appropriate for today, but certainly yes, I think multi multi cultures are are certainly on the cards. Okay. Mohammad Javad would like to know. Just r Turpin is produced in the engineered E. Coli with growth, or is it produced as a secondary metabolic light in the stationary phase? The program? Yeah. I don't have hard data to show you on that, but certainly in the early stages of growth. A lot of the strategy using the ladder are classical. Sort of what? The molecular biologist wouldn't get your biomass up and then induce,and switch on your your chemistry?yeah, I think at an academic level, that's what we would do. So you tend to sort of get production toward the end of the growth cycle when you're approaching station phase Clearly anymore, industrial context. When you don't want to be using induce double promoters, you might be working off more constitutive promoters that don't require induction. You might have a different regime. Many of these compounds, however, cited toxic. So you've also got to get that balance right as well. You don't want to make it too early so that you you start interfering with your biomass accumulation. So it's a bit of a fine balancing act if I'm honest and we're exploring many of those,different regimes in some of the scaling work that we're doing, he does ask what is the yield, Grandpa, Grandpa, Grandpa, Grandma substrate. I do well again, which probably you're talking about. So I I don't have that data for for the Turpin prototype pathways,mainly because we haven't determined that accurately. I think these are prototypes, trains, the ones I talked about today we have to go through optimization processes before we start looking. Stop kilometers of conversion. We have done that sort of work for our LPG work. I'm not sure I want to sort of share some of that data with at this stage because there's some commercial sensitivity. But we have done some of that work with some of our adapted strains. We have an anonymous question which is, Will such synthetic biology synthesized substances get rejected by the public in the same manner as GMOs? So how can we convince? People say, Well, the hope is not. The lesson has to be learned. And of course, when synthetic biology research councils and another funding came into this from the government injection in 2014, 13, then that was clearly very much on the agenda. And research councils quite rightly were determined that that conversation should happen early on so that we could de risk the acceptability of the engineering that we're doing,within the centers. So in the Manchester Center, we we have great leadership in this space from someone called Phil Shapira, who has driven really quite a lot of the,responsible research innovation work in the center and and offered some leadership nationally in that as well,we hope that those sort of conversations will well prevent another GMO situation backfiring on the on the symbiote world. thank you, Chris Newman. Thank you for your talk and asks, How far away are you from a commercial production of a monitor? 13. I can't tell you that. I'm afraid. Too sensitive. Watch this space. Sorry, Chris. The winner Froth asks. so he's a biochemistry in to get to it and was wondering what skills you would encourage for him to learn. If you wanted to get involved in bio engineering. That's a tough one. And I think, you know, there's a lot of skills. I mean, it really, truly is an interdisciplinary,challenge. And it's exciting for PG students who want to sort of work in this space. But, you know, you really have to sort of be agile, and you've got to be prepared to sort of jump in at the deep end. I mean, I I know I trained as an entomologist all right. You know, I don't know where I am these days, and some, some would say, a jack of all trades master of none. That's probably quite right, because, you know, we dabble in so much different stuff, and I think you have to do is a synthetic biology. You have to do some of the, you know, sort of computational design work. You've got to do the analytical chemistry strain engineering, the underpinning molecular biology. There's lots of conventional chemistry involved as well. It's a big arctic for any anybody training. So I would say, you know, look around at the training opportunities that you have. We think we do pretty well in the mid, and I'm sure the centers do it equally well, it's just that, you know, you need to find that sort of environment that supports it. Yeah, mhm. there were there. Was understood from Chris Newman. Govind Arrow. Sorry. Gavin says hello. Minas is indeed a good host for Ph. B. Was further path. Was the pathway further engineered for diverting flux from P h B two propane. Also. Sorry I missed how you store the propane in a lab environment. Thank you. So I can't tell you anything about the details of the engineering, because again there's there's sensitivities, I'm afraid in that process. I apologize for not being able to sort of give details. Ah, recovering. Probing from lifestyle Barry actors is relatively straightforward, of course, is the gas. So you don't have the same problem you have with other biofuels which are either stuck in the cell or stuck in the liquid of the reactor. It comes off as a gas, so you can just do a simple liquefaction.it's standard technology in the propane industry. My business partner is in the propane industry. He knows how to do that. So we have an instant network of expertise that we can drawn to help us do it. Okay. And you already asks, is there any opportunity to make more valuable bioproducts upstream from Pope propane, for example, Acrylic acid in principle? Yes,you know, as academics, of course, we're looking to derive value from existing pathways that we have in our center symbiotic, and indeed, in future P. R. H. A lot of the sort of initial pathways that we developed. We're looking to derive value from them. But we call them our gateway pathways because they open up, then routes to other close by chemicals of value. So we've done this recently. Flavonoids, for example. Our initial entry pathway there was elaborated further to make you know different types of flavonoids. So, yes, in principle, absolutely. There's always that opportunity. And it's relatively straightforward to do that. Well, I think you can tell from the width of the questioning it was a very well received talk. I think we've come to the end of the questions now. I'm sure all the participants are clapping at their screens and saying Thank you very much for such an inspiring talk. And I'd like to say Thank you very much for giving up your time to give us this talk. It's been excellent. Thank you very much. It's been a pleasure. I've enjoyed it. And I hope people have got something to take away with them. So thank you very much for inviting me. Thank you very much. Goodbye, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I hope to see you next month for our next Webinar. And lots of thanks on the chat. Okay. I will end the meeting. The reporting on the website once it's been processed. Okay, Thanks. Bye. Yeah,\""

              "\" welcome everyone October installment task Webinar series. great pleasure introduce fresh Nigel Stratton Manchester Institute Biotechnology Manchester University, talking microbial cell factor factories. Sorry, I've lost ability read, engineering biology chemical production. I hand straight tonight, could use Q A function ask questions answer questions end. Do technical difficulties issues would like introduce let us know from? Please use chat button. that, I hand straight Professor Scrutton. Okay, Thank much. Thanks. Very, kind introduction. It's pleasure afternoon able tell recent work engineering biology chemicals production manufacturing. So I'd like today discuss work establish establishing automated foundry microbial strain engineering impact chemicals fuels production, work translated scale commercial production selected advanced fuels. Mhm. So we're provide context, course, manufacturing significant contributor UK economy we're cusp. I think rapid expansion sector urgently try find solutions meet global challenges, example, government's clean growth zero carbon agendas. This especially important, I think, UK chemicals manufacturing sector, includes 3000 businesses employing around 100 53,000 people giving something like 19 billion gross value added turnover around 55 billion. So, course, majority comes petrochemicals. The fact that's increasingly odds Paris Agreement obligations 80% reduction greenhouse gas emissions 2050. So clearly urgently, need change transition sustainable manufacturing sector. That's part UK's economic recovery build back better following global pandemic. Now, course, U. K recognized world leader biotechnology. And,this especially true research base, delivers first rate discovery science.huh. The UK, however, needs better building back science based implement sustainable manufacturing technologies bring market. And I guess pre pandemic. The UK produced multiple roadmaps, many see slide vision documents shape future investment infrastructure training science technology programmes rapidly grow industrial biotechnology base. And I guess there's better time capitalize developments, especially approach next U. N Climate change conference Glasgow 2021 aim build back better clean growth. So I hope convince afternoon vibe Manchester instituted technology, we're developing research environment tackle science technology challenges establishing bio based manufacturing economy, especially areas fuels chemicals. And years, assembled strong interdisciplinary research community working together across biology, chemistry, materials, engineering competition, science areas really enabled us address ambitious challenge led research programs. And course, delighted recognized earlier year award Queen's anniversary prize. Recognizing MIB leadership UK's strategic development biotechnology manufacturing innovative technologies partnerships industry we've done assemble number capability platforms often supported major investments Care I industry. And provided focal points development new technology platforms engineering biology forming interactions external groups industry help pull academic discoveries towards industrial application. What I want today focus two key research areas. Synthetic biology bike analysis, also supported work we've structural biophysics analysis enzyme systems. So 2014, established symbol became one six synthetic biology research centres supported B B S. R. C platform center rapid engineering microbial strains fine specialty chemicals based bespoke design built Tesla platform we've developed within center. The chemicals production pipeline starts design stage shown purple here, set blueprints engineered microbial strains using suite design algorithms rapid strain engineering. These include design tools retros, emphasis cell design extended metabolic pathways access new chemical space enzyme selection engineering tools. We design select DNA parts, combine plasmid libraries using automated assembly instructions high throughput robotics built stage, prepares us assembly genetically encoded parts assembles plasmids via, example, like cycling reactions according automatically generated work lists drive laboratory automation fidelity assemble pathways checked, example, high throughput restriction analysis capillary electrophoresis, Nana DNA sequencing. And test stage encompasses hide throughput methods growth microbial production cultures, automated product extraction screening via fast liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. The results analyzed loan stage blue shaded panel slide predictive models using statistical methods machine learning inform next round design number iterations DBT l cycle, successful prototypes taken forward process development scale up. And so, establishing symbiotic pipeline, set really achieve number objectives. First all, pipeline agnostic target compound want produce also, certain extent host bacterial organism support production many different chemicals different host organisms. Secondly, leverage high throughput automation ensure rapid delivery new strains, improved performance also reduce human error engineering programs. Third, set provide software, platforms expertise could readily adopted wider synthetic biology community. Development symbiotic founder concept really phased phase one focus much developing underpinning capabilities pipeline around three target groups compounds. There's flavonoids, Turpin's alkaloids example groups, second phase, tested pipeline anger, carrying stress test determine many materials modern is, example, could produce biology three month window using symbiotic capabilities. So first stress test, set challenge seeing many materials modern could produce engineering E. Coli Using pipeline discussions local material scientists Manchester, identified list monomer targets used widely industry, selection targets list chosen based monomers either found natural bio synthesis routes ones synthetic synthetically accessible, based literature, information perspective retro synthetic research, selected 25 targets encompassing seven compound classes either materials, monitors compound precursors. These encompassed vinyl, benzene, xylene, benzene, mandalay, Tsai's beautiful compounds, dials, dines dark, box fillets, application areas polymer chemistry. We set notional 90 day limit walk design, build test learn cycle identify many unique strains capable synthesizing products could engineered, also characterize general properties titles products laboratory fermentation identify potential strains could enter second DBT L cycle. Focus time optimizing Titus reach graham polluter levels suitable large scale production. So class chemical target, new synthetic metabolic pathways selected following symbiotic, automated approach involves use retro synthesis software enzyme candidates step selected using design algorithm, cell enzyme via file, genetic analysis target compounds primary tab. A light precursors represented skeletal formula, whilst E. Coli metabolites represented abbreviations. Now, continuous arrows slide represents single enzyme step, whereas successive barriers represent multiple enzymatic transformations towards target compound. So target successfully produced. A new coal shown green. Those red original target list, enzymatic routes production found. Orange targets produced enigmatically vitro, fermentation E. Coli, blue structures identified compounds title raised substantially engineering E. Coli, example, knocking competing pathways boosting expression bio catalysts cell rounds strain engineering. The entire DB TL engineering cycle completed automated fashion within 85 days. The success rapid design engineering new bacterial strange reveals power believe prototyping strategy bio foundry approach discovering new pathways lead chemical space naturally found biology. We subsequently took small selection strains engineered produce Mandel eight Hydroxy Mandel eight put second stress test objective increasing Titus Grand Pelita scale. That second stress test likewise successful driving titles 1 10 g per liter scale values suitable consideration production scale compounds. So look outcome stress test simple numbers gallery, get feel capabilities construct pipeline within 85 day limit. We designed created 160 unique genetic parts DNA synthesis. We constructed verified sequencing 187 unique pathway constructs assembled. Using automated like cycling reaction methods, performed 150 unique enzyme assays created nine mutant E. Coli chassis using, example, genome engineering methods analyze 8000 samples using mass spectrometry part integrated test platform, developed 22 new mess quantification methods. The outcome standing standing starting point, create prototype strains 17 original 25 monomers interest, able access biologically five seven classes identified monomer types. So overall, estimate personnel consumable costs amounted around £15,000 per successful target, corresponding 360 personnel hours compound. And rigorous comprehensive benchmarking study feel showcases ability Bali founder provide quick affordable access diverse range chemicals microbial fermentation early prototype strains optimized scaled achieve. Graham pleaded fermentation basis large scale production, we've also interested exploring biological diversity chemical diversity using bio foundry approach. And time we've exploring Turpin chemistry attractive playground microbial chemicals production, Turpin's group naturally diverse, around 80 known compounds nature. In interests focusing subset compounds, concentrated monitor pins, C 10 compounds. Made eyes open precursors isa fentanyl, die phosphate dimethyl ala di phosphate. Now, many monitor peons major industrial applications used widely, example, flavorings, fragrances antiseptics. There also important precursors pharmaceuticals, bio plastics fuels. Currently, obtained either agricultural sources, subject seasonal variation, crop yields use land that, frankly, could better repurpose for, example, producing food synthesized chemically, challenge, given overall complex structures existence multiple stereo centers. And drives cost production purification desired products. So set discover compounds type could made readily using synthetic biology create plug play microbial prototype strain could produce vast array Turpin's. And, successful interested see selected, strains could optimized support production scale. So early development phases symbiote pipeline, focused three chemical groups. As I said previously, Turpin's Flavonoids Alkaloids, first demonstration pipeline flavonoids alkaloids, published 2018 prior material stress test I mentioned earlier. The Turpin work progressing extended timeline build series strange genetically encoded parts make vast array Turpin's engineered microbial strains, currently scaled specific applications industry partners. And again, I hope convince Bio Founder engineering biology provide attractive alternative routes production range industrial important chemicals also potentially expand chemical reach beyond easily attainable using synthetic chemistry methods. So line, I call this,image,monitor pinwheel. It indicates skeletal structures monitor pin scaffolds derived precursor paranoid shown bottom bottom wheel shown here, identify three subgroups. The Bice I click monitor pins, motorcycling A cyclic monitor pins. Under objective engineer prototype strains make compounds basis optimization ultimately scale production. The first task engineer feeder pathway gives rise common substrates For Turpin's that's journal de Phosphate. We others created pathways using variants called endogenous MPP pathways, generally results low interest levels ISA paranoid precursors using hydrologist envy, pathway created optimist recent years balance carbon flux stability contained tetralogy host. After synthesizing pathways progressive supply, objective introduce library monitor ping psych lasers host train, using plug play approach switch synthesis desired monetary cream product. Now, initially, targeted 2 3 non plant Turpin cycles individual scaffold, taken diverse source diverse source different plants hope detecting quantifying monitor PM product produced engineers' trains. This opens additional D PTL engineering, example, optimize product. Titus minimize cited toxicity products enable tailoring scaffolds make higher higher value products. So early designs relatively straightforward. We set two plasmid system feeder pathways contained single place. We've shown here,and second plastic containing journal de phosphate, entry enzyme required form G D. P, Turpin cyclists act switching different Turpin cyclers enzymes enables production different target monitor paeans studied. The feed pathways engineered optimize using enzymes taken multiple organisms. Color coded shown shown here, fine tuning metabolic flux engineered pathway also achieved machine learning affect translational tuning individual genes using libraries, synthetic rubbers binding sites boost production Titus 60% screening 3% arrivals binding site library MM facilitate library screening, multi well plate fermentation procedure developed, allowing increased screening throughout throughput sufficient resolution discriminate high low producers. This early optimization helped balance flux NVA pathway, coupled engineering, led production stable optimist plastic constructs production required ISA paranoid precursors. So achieved creation first generation library E. Coli strains make every natural monitor scaffold represented called monitor P wheel. This gives us access generalist platform E. Coli strains starting point optimization scale also chemical tailoring facilitate tailing. And also generated extensive bike analysis toolkit oxy functional ization Turpin's. By designing building cytochrome P 4 50 enzyme collection testing custom made untargeted GCMS met economics based approach, we're able rapidly create characteristics comprehensive library controlled oxy functional ization Turpin scaffold wide range activities selectivity, towards monitor shown here. We use novel cattle IT resource access extensive chemical diversity Turpin Lloyds pathway engineering assembly catalytic cascades subsequently produced libraries oxygenated Turpin roids derivatives diverse applications, example, Turpin based drug discovery. So outcome first generation engineering shown here, terms product profiles indeed, titles achieved Turpin scaffold. We able produce 30 different monitor paranoids glucose using 20 different Turpin synthesizers. Several novel scaffolds generated previously produced engineered microbes before, initial production levels exceeded most. Where selected examples previously produced engineered microbes, Turpin synthesis produced multiple products particular complex bys. I click products typically 60 70% total Turpin product bicycling type. Some compounds produced low titles, see here, examples include targets particularly interested Little Lulu. And finally, striking overall product profile profiles generally complex multiple products obtained psych lasers Turpin synthesizers, range product titles obtained. These affected many things. Optimizing pathway flux, enzyme expression, minimizing side product formation controlling effects sight toxicity important factors determining final title obtained. Moreover, engineering individual Turpin synthesizers finding alternative catalysts native give cleaner products clearly priority large scale production compounds. Now, reasons complex product profiles found really mechanistic details mode action Turpin synthesis. These enzymes initiate reaction cascade eliminating dye phosphate journal Die Phosphates left form journal. Katyn also shown second second structure slide. This undergoes I summarization form Little Island terminal captains point along reaction Cade cascade. These reactive enzyme intermediates undergo chemical reactions inter molecular attack offending double bombs, hydride protein migrations rearrangements change structure chemical staff. Scaffold. Ultimately, reactive intermediates quench deep rooted nation nuclear filic. Attack water hydrophobic residues enzyme active site rather oily substrate binding pocket. I make comparison ice cream scoop mold active site. But really give little chemical identity specifically position substrate active site. This hydrophobic binding pocket protects Qatar nick intermediates undirected attack water aromatic residues stabilised charged intermediates Qatar pie interactions. Now relatively inert active sites means very. There's little overall sequence similarity different Turpin psych lasers, exception small finger printer Sparta rich sequence motifs close,and second short motif, involved binding magnesium co factors. This lack overall sequence identity really complicates attempt rational design enzymes, season structure sequence guided protein engineering. And clearly problem one objective really tighten product profiles, example, production clean products microbial cell factories. major engineering challenge particular field. So given complex product profiles obtained many natural plant Turpin synthesis, recently switched attention mining Turpin synthesis bacterial species. And given poor sequence conservation active site, used hidden Markov model thematic search bacterial genome sequences identify new Turpin, cyclers enzymes. Using approach, we've identified 2867 punitive new bacterial Turpin synthesis using two finger print motifs I discussed briefly previous slide. And select multiple examples characterize overall activity using, example, GCMs type analysis. Most shown Cesc utopian dystopian synthesis, shown monitor prion synthesis. That said, identified specific line Alou serial Turpin synthesis we've got determine X ray structures product profiles showing fact, far superior catalysts producing compounds microbial cell factories compared plant enzymes. So we've shown bacterial enzymes simpler instruction. importantly, given much restrictive product profiles, I say, bacterial signal linear altarpieces. Since give cleaner product profiles predominantly form single product lifestyle fermentation, also enables much higher Titus reached particular products plug play platform. And enables us begin consider whether scale prototypes strains produce compounds ground per liter levels. Okay, I hope I've done far show foundry approach certainly useful rapidly generating prototypical strains. There optimized large scale fermentation, also give access chemistry may difficult access using conventional synthetic methods,and therefore really demonstrates power biology rapidly generating palliative like different chemical structures common common scaffold. What I'd like change tack little bit show microbial cell factory engineering also used make fuels biology. We've worked last seven eight years continue production liquefied petroleum gas, LPG, engineered microbial strains using fermented photo catalytic processes. This story that's gone early strain development large scale production bio LPGA pilots demonstrated scale and, recent years, establishment field biology company called C three biotech established, currently scaling commercializing bio LPG production technologies. So obvious question, first all, target LPG? Well, first all, important appreciate L. P. G varies across world, predominantly comprises propane, varying amounts butane combustible gases present depending source gas globally U. K L. P. G. Is almost entirely propane composition manufacturer clearly fossil sources. Now L. P G clean burning transport fuel, currently around 22 million tons per annum, holds important position domestic heating markets used 40 million homes worldwide also used extensively cooking non greenhouse gas refrigerant also aerosol propellant. There commercial technologies there. Yesterday, example, developed energy intensive chemical process conversion bio based glycerol. Two propane. But yet true biological roots LPG yet commercialized. Now L. P G excellent fuel. There low energy costs required liquefaction. It's easily transported, non greenhouse gas, therefore compares favorably alkaline gas fuels methane, major greenhouse gas produced traditional anaerobic digestion plants. So combines make L. P G. I think, attractive target production using microbial cell factories. And that's journey set follow last seven 87 eight years. Now, thinking this, I actually think worth really reflecting end product. What want achieve begin think design biology fit fit end game were? So forward thinking slide. We need ask bio LPG production plant might look like long term engineering process characteristics overall economics setting running plant could fed back early stage microbial strain engineering. To ensure biology aligned larger scale engineering challenges. Consequent, we've taken bottom systems engineering approach inform overall design clearly feedstock supplies central. We need able target, example, carbon dioxide industrial wastes, perhaps agriculture food biomass waste, plentiful supply UK We reliant freshwater, potentially scarce certain regions world also adds initial cost burden terms operation plant. So process is, therefore need run seawater brackish water. We want use field need obtain, need need clean carbon mutual bio RPGs explained, clean burning fuel distributed manufacturer local use would certainly minimize transportation costs carbon burden We also require simple downstream processing mitigate major costs. So embedding production existing infrastructures production transport, essentially drop solution. We need tailor different waste streams used effectively across globe. And needs low Capex OPEC's burden across supply chain production, use transport. So sort guiding principles clearly thinking terms developing biological process LPG production. So let's return basic science.first all, need develop biological route propane. Propane produced nature, existing natural pathways enzymes repurposed scale large scale production. So early inroads therefore design new metabolic pathways production source engineer enzymes could use biologically sourced metabolite turn propane gas. So, using DBT L type principle, created new version cluster deal fermentation pathway butin crucially adapted include newly discovered enzyme. Aldo Heidi Formulating oxygen radios labeled, see blue right hand panel bottom.and set engineer work short chain Aldo height substrates beautiful Aldo High. Our first target host E. Coli ease speed genetic manipulation, we've shown previous stress test material monitors, view prototypical pathway discovered could transferred robust industrial host could used effectively field. So general approach, early approaches summarized here. We slept number known catalysts individual step conceptual metabolic pathways propane synthesizing DNA encode assemble plasmid encoded pathways modular fashion. Using different plastic combinations, explore alternative routes along pathway, identified hatched shown here, well using bio catalyst supplied nature. We also repurpose selector catalyst improve target chemistry, especially radio enzyme, slow enzyme works best Long hair Aldo hides. Having assembled early pathways, set optimist switching switching new variants eliminating competing pathways targeted knock jeans ensure direct metabolites desired product. Propane, repurpose video protein engineering first challenge. The enzyme works best long chain alga heights. And get molecular view this,how substrate since solve crystal structure radio presence surrogate ligand problematic acid, coiffure purifies enzyme E. Coli. And see substrate accesses active site long hydrophobic channel boxful group presented Diane Center, area,of Potala. Sis conjectured hysteric blocking channel would exclude long chain substrates perhaps favor binding short chain Alba High. So number single multiple mutations made effective replacement residue. Alan E. 134 Alan in. You see slide see red album side chain blocking channel, structure variant indicated design intentions carried crystal structures short urging substrates. We introduced engineered enzymes plastic constructs, assembled parts pathway genes leading cell metabolite acetyl coa way final product propane fermentation 12 hour period analytical skill indicated fact, propane generated using pathway, albeit relatively small amounts. But despite low Titus, first Clostridium like fermentation pathway shown produce propane gas establishes important proof concept. The title dependent metabolic route followed, indicated red green bars. Beyond proof concept studies lab scale, exploratory five 400 liter scales also demonstrated, low tighter clearly challenge, part due low activity radio. We've engaged directed evolution rational engineering studies video. But improvements catalytic activity hard one hindered fact still unsure limiting overall cabinet cycle intriguing enzyme. So slide visualize airlift fermenter developed C three Biotech, spin company investigate early scale challenges appropriate production. Using engineer coli strains produced, E. Coli supported using glycerol processing plant.from movie, I, I hope works screen here, generate. I guess might work I can't access cursor. There movie here, hope. I'm sure going work. Ah, is. You actually see mixture propane, another flammable gases burning early fermenter.there's propane there. It's entirely propane. It's mixture final gases well. But really least demonstrate proof concept propane produce. To extent,in larger scale,fermented. Yeah, challenges here. Clearly, system would want scale stage. Because low titles produced, cost setting sterile fermentation.we E. Coli many engineering challenges set out. And end, decided fact, radio probably ideal enzyme supporting short chain alcohol production microbial cell factories. So armed knowledge radios like support large scale production M. I B number us institute looking potential enzymes could give rise vulnerable fuels.for example, we've M. I. B Y program mechanism structure number enzymes, used produce Calkins al canes. And indeed, Turpin fuels I've mentioned briefly. Some enzymes shown here, really, game changer us report science 2017 new photo enzyme isolated algae, using blue light like box long chain fatty acids short, short chain al canes. So within paper science, structure enzyme reported Sergei. It'll provided required insight long chain fatty acid binding active site cliff could targeted rational design towards substrates. The national Catholic cycle also presented authors involving FD photo chemistry Deco oxalate, fatty acid, using excited state flavor chemistry. And part characterization enzyme, we've done spectroscopic analyses particular catalyst determine overall reaction mechanism. These studies reported recently CSKA Talese's earlier year Brief. We able demonstrate Red Intermediate formed even cryogenic conditions glass phase transition proteins, implying chemical changes dependent larger scale protein motion. But decay red intermediate much dependent protein structural change happens temperatures glass phase transition. I dwell studies today. The paper anyone's interested follow up. We also able using laser excitation experiments look proton transfer hygiene transfer reactions associated formation decay red intermediate able begin deconstruct overall reaction mechanism proton transfer pathways indeed identify key residues active site. And I pointed sustained residue assisting 432 showed involved formation decay particular red intermediate. What means we've able advance understanding overall reaction mechanism. First all, concerns sister residue found fat monologues. F AP Hama logs shown sequence alignment here, emphasizing potential importance photo chemistry. That system close FAA Deco factor, believe gets involved chemistry series hygiene transfer electron transfer reactions. Essentially, happens following Flavin excitation, get home Olympic vision carbon carbon bond substrate form CO two, Al came radical, arcane radical satisfied H atom. Transfer active site sustain form violent radical species, translate form interaction F D. That's road intermediate relax back resting form enzyme. So armed knowledge, clearer understanding mechanism, factored rational engineering enzyme specificity. Our strategy shown here, course, classical, anaerobic digestion, type processes indeed, processes derived widely available biomass. You get volatile fatty acids, streams. We think Dick approximating volatile fatty acids using single enzymatic step using photo Dick approximates form propane, isa, butane beauty. So overall strategy go particular direction. But course, fatty acid decay Box Hill predominantly works long chain Aldo Heights. And first challenge really try profile, like specificity enzyme work shorter chain short chain fatty acids, right?huh. So created series of,mutant constructs,informed structure.and see sequence,window able identify residues involved redefining. If like substrate specificity enzyme. We've generated many variants of,FAP extensive media genesis cycle, single substitution. So multiple substitutions, we've able sort of,if like, I identify sequence window key changes really alter specificity of,of enzyme short chain short chain, valuable, volatile fatty acids, see screening outputs here. So variants, able work C three C four hydrocarbon fatty acids indeed, C three C four hydrocarbon blends. That's important wherever world, course, L P G comprises propane, butane short chains. And might want fine tune L P G content, depending type of,of F A P enzyme using microbial cell factory now. Previously, I mentioned prototype work done in,in E. Coli. But really, need translate into,into robust, robust industrial hosts. So confidential fermentation czar. Clearly costly, terms Capex investments ongoing OPEC's training costs. fermentation typically uses extensive, expensive steel fermenters monitoring systems. It requires aeration mixing DSP sterilization costs and, course, extensive use fresh fresh water water. So strong collaboration George Kennan, Qinghua University Beijing, George sort world leader terms using extremophiles halo files hosts next generation technology. And worked George recent years to,if like, translate much chemicals pathways Halo Philly coasts. And beauty hey, Lemonis use low cost reactors. We need sterilization high slanting gates sterilization processes strains grow seawater. They use simple waste carbon sources growth feedstocks. They're genetically tractable, And,it's already demonstrated existing robust industrial host. So lab scale work looked propane production clean crude biodiesel media. You see slide, we've able show production propane hello Mona, indicated top right hand panel. And what's more, intense times introducing to,this description I've described see performance actually much improved see using E. Coli host, I published propane levels around 0.2 g per liter culture. Hey, Lemonis got high tolerance substrate use photo Catalytic conversion. We get growth non sterile seawater,and forth. All characteristics want see beginning emerge new, new platform talk. What's more, place intense times photosynthetic organisms cynic assistance, also demonstrate propane production seo 2 ft stocks. This therefore opens exciting possibility making gazing. Hydrocarbon fuels CO two titles case, although we're seeing. Helen bonuses clearly rounds optimization done here. But again, establish important proof proof concept development making fuels co two. So I hope I've done give flavor type trajectory we're pursuing academically open access sort of,commercial ventures.the sort work we're clearly much happening that's commercially sensitive company I can't talk today. But done demonstrate proof concept bio LPG production. Using engineered microbial cell factories, we've performed technical economics L c A. To inform route scale production based foundational strains. And C three biotech engaged experimental pilot plant developments guide scale feed back iterations strain engineering,to ultimately impact economics productivity production. I'm conscious I've probably gone time slightly, So I I think I finish. But I that, I'd like finish really thanking many researchers contributed research process I've discussed today funding various agencies. In particular. I'd like thank staff Symbiotic M Center Manchester done lot strain automation strain engineering. But also future Rh, second center Steve risking much scale work people research group really pushed L P G type work also important collaborators. We've worked Patrick Jones Imperial College project early stages indeed civic assistance work also good collaborator Beijing, George Chen, we've much work one halem owners. Funders are, course, u K R I. But increasingly, industry funded programs coming C three biotech. That's I'll finish. And I'm certainly happy take questions people them. Thank you. thank much. Like little really excellent talk, really thought provoking talk well, Especially me, who's sort inorganic engineer bio? Really fascinating. We couple questions already popping questions. Maria asks says. It's amazing example targeted engineering nature, like know economical viability process, estimation price price product, need purify listen sea what's expensive? The DBT L cycle? Yeah, okay. Both excellent questions. We've done quite lot early stage technical economic analysis, particularly bio LPG, imagine we've got real challenge. L P G expensive.so process that's competitive existing manufacturing processes going be,a significant challenge. The answer here, I think, micro microbial cell factory. Just making propane alone making LPG alone. He's not. He's going compete cost, way forward, I think, take integrated refinery type approach. But Symbian Fi, approach, I mean take chassis makes LPG also make multiple products. We've looked detail published paper came earlier year, we've got different case scenarios. We've done technical economics L C A types approach 10 11 different case studies follow case, studies see really bring cost manufacture point becomes, view, economically viable proposition. That's approach we're taking company. And also approach used feed back engineering strains. Mhm. The second part, question, I think, rate limiting step DBT l expensive step DBT. Gosh, I think expensive step staff resource. If I'm brutally honest Capital Investment setting platform terms consumable running costs, I think that's really hard de construct. I I think,you know, imagine, platform type takes lot expensive equipment running maintain multiple mass spectrometers. Robotics forth constant manager's nightmare terms finally money make sure kept working. So actually, I think that's real real cost staff resource, consumable costs,time, perhaps less so. Do hope answers question. Maria Stephen Wallace would like ask, thank great talk says wondering photo active car box lays inside cell also inside fermenter. Yeah, that's really good question, too, know challenge photo active system like penetration cells.and that's going engineering challenge Moving forward. We're aware that. We've done scoping experiments, lab scale try try tackle that, certainly lab scale. Fermenter when? Later. Half liter. We We show drive reaction life cells.the problem. Working photo bio catalyst excited state, enzyme pretty unstable. The chemistry reactive chemistry, actually, enzyme undergoes inactivation pretty quickly, even life cell. So constantly generate biomass recover catalyst. It's bit like chemical industry. You make catalyst. It gets poisoned, going remake it. The good thing biology remaking catalyst expensive. You regrow box. So number issues deal here. Like penetration warm. We're generating catalyst other. Thank you. Stephen also asks, What think future role traditional synthetic chemists strain? Engineering becomes routine gradually move away petrochemicals. Well, careful I say here. You probably tell I'm passionate know, role bio founders is. Where complementary achieve using conventional synthetic approaches. They'll always chemistry biology can't do. But might also chemistry biology. Do Chemistry can't so. You know, I I really see twin track approach. Really?getting closer time developing,programs processes synthetic biology part part journey I think important thing. Let give example. Synthetic biology really good making carbon scaffold. As I showed today. Turpin scaffolds Taylor scaffolds precise Oxy functional ization editions might either synthetic chemistry challenge. Or might sort wholesale purified bike analysis type, sort things U. K bike analysis sort theme palaces heart. So I think things exclusive. They integrated part sort hybrid work stream moving forward. But I think symbiote certainly make scaffolds effectively cheaply. If answers question. Stephen Coolest six grands Karen. Sorry. Pronounce really badly, I'm sure asks, Did manage express difficult express membrane bound cytochrome P 4 50 enzymes E. Coli, part processes? So stayed away membrane bound sort Mormon alien type UK Arctic P four fiftiesand we,and everyone knows works P four fifties working membrane bound systems bit nightmare fact, probably one reasons P four fifties widely exploited conventional industrial black analysis, tend concentrate mutant variant forms bacterial systems. You well characterized people 50 people three, sort enzymes. There many variants available labs world, that's That's sort repository enzymes used basis work. said that, able find catalysts could really oxy functionally different positions Turpin's discussed. And Bill Stubs would like know. Is market bio based short chain fatty acids? I'd like know obvious reasons. And anyone knows market short chain, smelly, volatile acids, please let know. Drop email. I'd delighted hear you. I'm sure is, I quite know details that. So anyone's got insight, please let know. Okay. You McDonnell would like thank talk ask. place multi species strain communities bacteria improve stability, act synergy mitigate species, strain specific weaknesses large scale fermentation bio services opposed stringer. Singular strains DBT cycles. I think answer yes. Very likely. Very probably variety reasons. Shuttling intermediates one.first all, getting complex metabolic pathway work single host probably quite difficult.a real challenge terms engineering biology do. Making two smaller strains communicate perhaps share problems one substrate another obvious strategy. There many strategies might require work multiple organisms. So, short, yes.I could probably talk another half hour sort application areas might case. I probably appropriate today, certainly yes, I think multi multi cultures certainly cards. Okay. Mohammad Javad would like know. Just r Turpin produced engineered E. Coli growth, produced secondary metabolic light stationary phase? The program? Yeah. I hard data show that, certainly early stages growth. A lot strategy using ladder classical. Sort what? The molecular biologist get biomass induce,and switch chemistry?yeah, I think academic level, that's would do. So tend sort get production toward end growth cycle approaching station phase Clearly anymore, industrial context. When want using induce double promoters, might working constitutive promoters require induction. You might different regime. Many compounds, however, cited toxic. So also got get balance right well. You want make early start interfering biomass accumulation. So bit fine balancing act I'm honest we're exploring many those,different regimes scaling work we're doing, ask yield, Grandpa, Grandpa, Grandpa, Grandma substrate. I well again, probably talking about. So I I data Turpin prototype pathways,mainly determined accurately. I think prototypes, trains, ones I talked today go optimization processes start looking. Stop kilometers conversion. We done sort work LPG work. I'm sure I want sort share data stage there's commercial sensitivity. But done work adapted strains. We anonymous question is, Will synthetic biology synthesized substances get rejected public manner GMOs? So convince? People say, Well, hope not. The lesson learned. And course, synthetic biology research councils another funding came government injection 2014, 13, clearly much agenda. And research councils quite rightly determined conversation happen early could de risk acceptability engineering we're doing,within centers. So Manchester Center, great leadership space someone called Phil Shapira, driven really quite lot the,responsible research innovation work center offered leadership nationally well,we hope sort conversations well prevent another GMO situation backfiring symbiote world. thank you, Chris Newman. Thank talk asks, How far away commercial production monitor? 13. I can't tell that. I'm afraid. Too sensitive. Watch space. Sorry, Chris. The winner Froth asks. he's biochemistry get wondering skills would encourage learn. If wanted get involved bio engineering. That's tough one. And I think, know, there's lot skills. I mean, really, truly interdisciplinary,challenge. And exciting PG students want sort work space. But, know, really sort agile, got prepared sort jump deep end. I mean, I I know I trained entomologist right. You know, I know I days, some, would say, jack trades master none. That's probably quite right, because, know, dabble much different stuff, I think synthetic biology. You the, know, sort computational design work. You've got analytical chemistry strain engineering, underpinning molecular biology. There's lots conventional chemistry involved well. It's big arctic anybody training. So I would say, know, look around training opportunities have. We think pretty well mid, I'm sure centers equally well, that, know, need find sort environment supports it. Yeah, mhm. there. Was understood Chris Newman. Govind Arrow. Sorry. Gavin says hello. Minas indeed good host Ph. B. Was path. Was pathway engineered diverting flux P h B two propane. Also. Sorry I missed store propane lab environment. Thank you. So I can't tell anything details engineering, there's there's sensitivities, I'm afraid process. I apologize able sort give details. Ah, recovering. Probing lifestyle Barry actors relatively straightforward, course, gas. So problem biofuels either stuck cell stuck liquid reactor. It comes gas, simple liquefaction.it's standard technology propane industry. My business partner propane industry. He knows that. So instant network expertise drawn help us it. Okay. And already asks, opportunity make valuable bioproducts upstream Pope propane, example, Acrylic acid principle? Yes,you know, academics, course, we're looking derive value existing pathways center symbiotic, indeed, future P. R. H. A lot sort initial pathways developed. We're looking derive value them. But call gateway pathways open up, routes close chemicals value. So we've done recently. Flavonoids, example. Our initial entry pathway elaborated make know different types flavonoids. So, yes, principle, absolutely. There's always opportunity. And relatively straightforward that. Well, I think tell width questioning well received talk. I think we've come end questions now. I'm sure participants clapping screens saying Thank much inspiring talk. And I'd like say Thank much giving time give us talk. It's excellent. Thank much. It's pleasure. I've enjoyed it. And I hope people got something take away them. So thank much inviting me. Thank much. Goodbye, everyone. Thank joining us. I hope see next month next Webinar. And lots thanks chat. Okay. I end meeting. The reporting website processed. Okay, Thanks. Bye. Yeah,\""

              "\"Um welcome everyone to the october installment of the task hub webinar series um, it's my very great pleasure to introduce fresh and nigel stratton from the manchester institute of biotechnology in manchester university um, who will be talking about microbial cell factor factories. Sorry, i've lost my ability to read an engineering biology for chemical production. I will hand straight over to nigel, but if you could use the q a function to ask questions and we will answer all the questions at the end, if you have any technical difficulties or any issues or would like to introduce yourself and let us know where You'Re from please use the chat button and, on that i'll hand straight over to professor scrotum, okay. Thank you very much. Thanks for a very kind introduction, uh, it's a pleasure to be with you all this afternoon and for me to be able to tell you about our recent work on engineering biology for chemicals, production and biomanufacturing. So what i'd like to do today is to discuss our work on establish, establishing an automated biofoundry for microbial strain engineering and the impact that this is having on chemicals and fuels production and then how some of this work is now being translated to scale for the Commercial production of selected, advanced fuels so really just to provide some context. Of course, by manufacturing is a significant contributor to the uk economy and we're now on the cusp, i think, of rapid expansion of this sector, as we urgently try to find solutions to meet uh global challenges. For example, the government's clean growth and zero carbon uh genders - and this is especially important - i think in the uk chemicals manufacturing sector, which includes over 3 000 businesses employing around about 153 000 people and giving something like 19 billion in gross value added to a turnover Around about 55 billion, so of course the majority of this comes from petrochemicals a fact: that's increasingly odds with the paris agreement, obligations and and 80 reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. So clearly and urgently, we need to change and transition to a more sustainable biomanufacturing sector as part of the uk's economic recovery, as we build back better following the global pandemic. Now, of course, the uk is recognized as a world leader in in biotechnology, and this is especially true in the research base which delivers first rate discovery. Science. The uk, however, needs to do better at building back from this science base to implement sustainable biomanufacturing technologies and bring them to market, and i guess pre-pandemic - the uk produced multiple roadmaps. Many of them. You see on the slide here and vision documents to shape future investment. In infrastructure, training and science and technology programs to rapidly grow the industrial biotechnology base, and so i guess there's no better time than now to capitalize on these developments, especially as we approach the next u.n climate change conference in glasgow in 2021. As we aim to build back better through clean growth, so what i hope to convince you of this afternoon is that at the mib or the manchester institute of biotechnology we're developing a research environment to tackle the science and technology challenges of establishing a buy-based manufacturing economy. Especially in the areas of fuels and and chemicals, and over the years, mib has assembled a strong interdisciplinary research community, working together across the biology chemistry, materials, engineering and computational science areas, uh. That really has enabled us to address ambitious challenge-led research programs and of course, we were delighted to be recognized earlier this year through the award of the queen's anniversary prize recognizing mib's leadership in the uk's strategic development of biotechnology and by manufacturing through innovative technologies and partnerships. With industry now in mib, what we've done is to assemble a number of capability platforms that have often been supported by major investments from ukrai and industry, and these are provided focal points for the development of new technology platforms, for engineering biology and for forming interactions. With external groups and industry to help pull through academic discoveries towards industrial application, what i want to do today is focus on two key research areas: synthetic biology and biocatalysis, but also supported by work. We'Ve been doing in the structural and biophysic analysis of enzyme systems, so in 2014 we established symbiotic m one of the uh six uh synthetic biology research, centers uh, supported by the bbsrc as a platform center for the rapid engineering of microbial strains for fine and specialty Chemicals based on a bespoke design-built, tesla and platform that we've developed within the center, the chemicals production pipeline, starts at the design stage shown in purple here, where we set out blueprints for engineered microbial strains using a suite of design algorithms for rapid strain engineering. These include design tools for retrosynthesis in the cell and the design of extended metabolic pathways to access new chemical space and enzyme selection and engineering tools. We can then design and select dna parts, combine them into plasmid libraries using automated assembly instructions and high throughput robotics, and the build stage then prepares us for the assembly of these genetically encoded parts and assembles them into plasmids via, for example, ligase cycling reactions according to Automatically generated work, lists that drive the laboratory, automation and the fidelity of the assembled pathways is then checked, for example, by high throughput restriction, analysis and capillary electrophoresis or by nanopore dna sync sequencing, and then the test stage encompasses high throughput methods for the growth of microbial Uh production, cultures, automated product extraction and screening via fast liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. The results are analyzed in the learn stage of the blue shaded panel on the slide, through predictive models using statistical methods of machine learning to inform the next round of design. And after a number of iterations of this dbtl cycle, successful prototypes are then taken forward to process development and scale up, and so in establishing the sim by chem pipeline. We set out really to achieve a number of objectives. First of all, the pipeline should be agnostic to the target compound that we want to produce and also to a certain extent, to the host bacterial organism, so that we can support the production of many different chemicals from different host organisms. Secondly, it should leverage high throughput automation to ensure rapid delivery of new strains, and this improved performance should also reduce human error in the engineering programmes. Third, we set out to provide software platforms and expertise that could then be readily adopted by the wider synthetic biology community. Now development of the symbiofoundry concept was really phased in phase, one that we focus very much on developing the underpinning capabilities of the pipeline around three uh target groups of compounds, those being flavonoids terpenes and alkaloids as exemplar groups, and then in the second phase. We then tested the pipeline in anger, carrying out a stress test to determine how many materials monomers, for example, that we could produce from biology in a three-month window using the symbiocan capabilities. So, in the first stress test, we set ourselves the challenge of seeing how many materials monomers we could produce by engineering e coli using the pipeline and in discussions with local materials scientists. At manchester, we identified a list of monomer targets used widely by industry, and a selection of these targets from the list was chosen based on monomers that were either found in natural biosynthesis roots or ones that are biosynthetic by synthetically, accessible based on literature, information and prospective Bioretrosynthetic research, we selected 25 targets encompassing seven compound classes that were either materials monomers or compound precursors. These encompass uh, vinyl, benzenes, alloy, benzenes, mandalas, isobutyl compounds, diols, dienes and carboxylates, each with our own application areas in polymer chemistry. We then set ourselves a notional 90-day limit to walk through the design, build test and learn cycle to identify how many unique strains capable of synthesizing. These products could be engineered and also to characterize general properties, such as the titers of products in laboratory fermentations, and to identify potential strains that could enter a second dbtl cycle, focus this time on optimizing titers to reach gram per liter levels suitable for large scale production. So for each class of chemical target, new synthetic metabolic pathways were selected following the symbiocam automated approach, which involved the use of retrosynthesis software enzyme. Candidates for each step were selected using our design, algorithm cell enzyme and via phylogenetic analysis and the target compounds and prime metabolite precursors are represented here, uh by skeletal formula, whilst other e coli metabolites are represented by abbreviations. Now the continuous arrows on the on the slide represent a single enzyme step, whereas successive arrows represent multiple enzymatic transformations uh toward the target compound. So targets successfully produced in the e coli are shown in green. Those in red were from the original target list, but for which enzymatic roots to their production were not found. Orange targets were produced enzymatically in vitro, but not during fermentation of e coli and the blue structures identified compounds for which the title was raised substantially by engineering e coli, for example, by knocking out competing pathways or by boosting expression of biocatalyst in the cell through further Rounds of strain engineering, the entire dbtl engineering cycle was completed in automated fashion within 85 days. The success of the rapid design and then the engineering of new bacterial strains reveals the power that we believe of the prototyping strategy of the biofoundry approach in discovering new pathways. That can lead to chemical space, not naturally found in biology. We subsequently took a small selection of these strains that have been engineered to produce mandalay and hydroxymandulate and put them through a second stress test, with the objective of increasing titers to the gram per liter scale. That second stress test was likewise successful, driving titus into the one to ten gram per liter scale, values that are now suitable for consideration of production scale up for these compounds. So if we look at the outcome of the stress test is a simple numbers gallery, we can get a feel for the capabilities of the constructor pipeline within the 85-day limit. We designed and created 160 unique genetic parts by dna synthesis we constructed and verified by sequencing. 187, unique pathway constructs assembled using our automated ligacycline reaction methods. We performed over 150 unique enzyme, assays created nine mutant e coli chassis, using, for example, genome engineering methods that we analyze more than 8 000 samples using mass spectrometry as part of the integrated test platform, and we developed 22 new ms quantification methods. The outcome is that from a standing standing starting point, we created prototype strains for 17 out of the original 25 monomers of interest and we were able to access biologically five out of seven classes of identified monomer types. So, overall, we estimate that the personnel and consumable costs amounted to around about fifteen thousand pounds per successful target, corresponding to 360 personnel hours per compound. And this rigorous and comprehensive benchmarking study. We feel now showcases the ability of body foundries to provide quick and affordable access to a diverse range of chemicals by microbial fermentation and how these early prototype strains can now be optimized and scaled up to achieve grampalito fermentation as the basis for large-scale production. So we've also been interested in exploring biological diversity and chemical diversity using the the biofoundry uh approach, and for some time now, we've been exploring terpene chemistry as an attractive playground for microbial chemicals production, as the terpenes group is naturally very diverse. With up to around about 80 000 known compounds in nature, in the interest of focusing on the subset of these compounds, we concentrated on the mono terpenes, which are c10 compounds made from the isopronate precursors, isopentanol, diphosphate and dimethylal diphosphate. Now many of these molar terpenes have major industrial applications and are used widely, for example, as flavourings fragrances and antiseptics, and are also important precursors for pharmaceuticals, bioplastics and fuels currently they're obtained from either agricultural sources, which are subject to seasonal uh variation, crop yields and use Land that, frankly, could be better repurposed for, for example, for producing food or they're synthesized chemically, which in itself is a challenge given their overall complex structures and the existence of multiple stereocenters, and this dries up the cost of production and purification of the desired products. So we set out to discover if compounds of this type could be made readily using synthetic biology and to create a plug-and-play microbial prototype strain that could produce a vast array of terpenes and if successful, we were then interested to see if selected strains could be optimized. Further to support production at scale, so during the early development phases of the symbiote chem pipeline, we we focused on three chemical groups, as i said previously, terpenes, flavonoids and alkaloids. Our first demonstration of the pipeline with flavonoids and alkaloids was published in 2018 prior to the material stress test that i mentioned earlier. The terpene work has been progressing over an extended timeline to build up a series of strains and genetically encoded parts to make a vast array of terpenes in engineered microbial strains, some of which are currently being scaled for specific applications within the with industry partners and again. What i hope to do is to convince you that the biofounders and the engineering of biology provide attractive alternative routes to the production of a range of industrially, important chemicals and also potentially expand the chemical reach beyond that easily attainable using synthetic chemistry methods. So on this slide, i i call this uh image the monoterpene wheel. It indicates the skeletal structures of all monoterpene scaffolds derived from the precursor isoprenoid shown at the bottom of the the bottom of the wheel shown here. We can identify three subgroups, the bicyclic monoterpenes, the monocyclic and the acyclic monoterpenes, and our objective was to engineer prototype strains that could make each of these compounds as a basis for further optimization and ultimately scale up for production. The first task was to engineer the feeder pathway that gives rise to common substrates for all these terpenes. That'S geranyl diphosphate. We and others have created such pathways using variants of the so-called endogenous mep pathways, which generally results in low intracellular levels of the isoprene precursors or using a heterologous mva pathway that we have created and optimized in recent years to balance carbon flux and stability when contained In a heterologous host after synthesizing these pathways for progressive supply, our objective was then to introduce a library of monoterpene cyclases into the host strain, using a plug-and-play approach to switch on the synthesis of the desired monoterpene product. Now, initially, we targeted uh two to three known plant terpene cyclases, for each individual scaffold taken from a diverse source of a diverse source of different plants in the hope of detecting and quantifying the monoterpene product produced from the engineer's trains. This then opens up additional dptl engineering, for example, to optimize product titers, minimize cytotoxicity of the products and enable tailoring of the scaffolds to make uh higher higher value products. So early designs were relatively straightforward. We set up a two plasmid system with the feeder pathways contained in a single plasma shown here and with a second plasmid containing journal diphosphate. The entry enzyme that is required to form gdp on which the terpene cyclase can can then act switched in and out of different terpene. Cyclase enzymes then enables production of different target monoterpenes to be studied. The mva feeder pathways were engineered and optimized using enzymes taken from multiple organisms, color coded as shown as shown here and fine-tuning of metabolic flux. Through this, engineered mva pathway was also achieved through machine learning to affect translational tuning of individual genes using libras as synthetic ribosome binding sites to boost production titus by over 60 when screening under three percent of a ribosome binding site library to facilitate library, screening a multi-well Uh plate fermentation procedure was developed, allowing increased screening throughout throughput with sufficient resolution to discriminate between high and low producers, and this early optimization has helped to balance the flux through the nva pathway and when, coupled with further engineering, has led to the production of stable and Optimized plasmid constructs for the production of the required isoprenoid precursors, so what we have achieved is the creation of a first generation library of e coli strains that can make every natural monoterpene scaffold represented in the so-called monoterpene wheel. This then gives us access to a generalized platform of e coli strains as a starting point for optimization for scale up and also for further chemical tailoring and to facilitate talion. We also generated an extensive biocatalysis toolkit for the oxy functionalization of terpenes uh by designing and building a cytochrome p450 enzyme collection and testing it in a custom-made, untargeted, gcms metabolomics, based approach, we're able to rapidly create and characterize a comprehensive library for the controlled oxyfunctionalization of Terpene scaffolds with a wide range of activities and selectivities towards all the monoterpene shown here. We can now use this novel by catalytic resource to access the extensive chemical diversity of terpenoids by further pathway engineering through the assembly of biocatalytic cascades to subsequently produce libraries of oxygenated terpenoids and their derivatives for diverse applications, for example, terpene-based drug discovery. So the outcome of the first generation engineering is shown here both in terms of product profiles and indeed titus achieved for each of the mod terpene scaffolds. We were able to produce more than 30 different monoterpenoids from glucose using 20 different terpene synthases. Several novel scaffolds were generated not previously produced in engineered microbes before and initial production levels were exceeded for most uh, where selected examples have been previously produced in engineered microbes. Most terpene synthases, however, produce a multiple products and, in particular, complex bicyclic products, where typically only 60 to 70 percent of the total terpene product is of the bicyclic type. Some compounds are produced at very low titers, as we can see here, and examples include targets that we were particularly interested in linoleum and terpinoli. What is striking overall is that the product prior profiles were generally very complex and multiple products were obtained with, with most cyclases or terpene synthases and a range of product titers were obtained. These were affected by many things: optimizing the pathway, flux, enzyme, expression, minimizing site, product formation and controlling the effects of cytotoxicity are all important factors in in in determining the the final title obtained uh. Moreover, engineering, individual terpene synthesis or finding alternative catalysts in nature to give cleaner products is clearly a priority for large-scale production of these compounds. Now the reasons for the complex product profiles are found really in the mechanistic details of the mode of action of terpene synthases. These enzymes initiate the reaction cascade by eliminating the diphosphate of geruno diphosphate shown on the left here, uh to form the gerund cation also shown here in the second, the second structure. On the slide. This then undergoes isomerization to form the linoleil and terminal cations and any point along the reaction k at cascade these uh reactive enzyme intermediates can undergo further chemical reactions such as intramolecular attack on all filling double bonds hydride or protein migrations and rearrangements to change. The structure of the chemical staff scaffold, ultimately, the reactive intermediates are quenched by deprotonation or nucleophilic attack by water. Now, hydrophobic residues in the enzyme active site form this rather oily substrate binding pocket. I make the comparison here with an ice cream scoop and that we can mold the active site, but we really give it little uh chemical identity to specifically position the substrate in the active site. This hydrophobic binding pocket protects the cationic intermediates from the undirected attack of water and aromatic residues stabilize the charged intermediates by cation pi interactions. Now these relatively inert active sites means it's very there's very little overall sequence, similarity between different terpene cyclases, with the exception of small fingerprint aspartate, rich sequence, motifs, uh, close and and a second short motif, which is involved in binding the magnesium cofactors. This lack of overall sequence, identity really complicates any attempt at rational design and of the of these enzymes used in structure and sequence guided protein engineering. This is clearly a problem when one has the objective to really tighten up product profiles, for example, for the production of a clean uh product in our microbial cell factories, and this is a major engineering challenge for this particular field. So, given the complex product profiles obtained with many of the natural plant terpene synthesis more recently, we switched our attention to mining terpene synthases from bacterial species and given the poor sequence conservation, the active site, we used a hidden mark of model, informatics search of bacterial genome Sequences to identify new terpene cyclase enzymes, using this approach, we've identified 2167 putative new bacterial terpene synthases, using the two fingerprint motifs. I discussed briefly on the previous slide and then we selected multiple examples and characterized their overall activity uh using, for example, gcms type analyses most were shown to be sesquiterpine and diterpian synthases, and only a few were shown to be monoterpene synthases. That said, we have identified specific lineal and sineal terpene synthesis we've gone to determine their x-ray structures and product profiles and shown. These are in fact, far superior as catalysts for producing those compounds in in microbial cell factories compared to the plant enzymes. So we've shown that the bacterial enzymes are simpler in structure and, more importantly, give much more restrictive product profiles uh. As i say, the bacterial cynial and lineal terpene synthesis not only give cleaner product profiles but predominantly form uh, a single product uh in uh lifestyle fermentations. It also enables much higher titus to be reached for these particular products in our plug-and-play platform, and this then enables us to begin to consider whether we can scale up some of these prototype strains uh to produce these compounds that ground per liter levels. Okay. So what i hope i've done so far is to show that uh, the biofoundry approach is, is certainly useful in rapidly generating prototypical strains uh. That can be then further optimized for larger scale fermentations, but also give you access to chemistry that may be difficult to access using conventional synthetic methods and therefore that really demonstrates the power of biology uh in in rapidly generating a palette. If you like, of different chemical structures, uh from a common uh from a common scaffold, what i'd like to do now is to change tack a little bit and show you how microbial cell factory engineering can also be used to make fuels from biology. We'Ve worked for the last seven or eight years and continue to do so on the production of liquefied petroleum gas or lpg from engineered microbial strains using fermentative and photocatalytic processes. This is a story. That'S gone from early strain development to large-scale production of bio-lpg at pilots. To demonstrate a scale, and in recent years, the establishment of a fields from biology company called c3 biotech that we established, which is currently scaling and commercializing our bio lpg production technologies. So the obvious question, first of all, is why target lpg? Well, first of all, it's a it's important to appreciate that lpg varies across the world, predominantly it comprises propane, but there are varying amounts of butane and other combustible gases present, depending on where you source the gas globally. In the uk, lpg is almost entirely propane in in composition, and its manufacturer is clearly from fossil sources. Now lpg is a very clean burning transport fuel currently around about 22 million tons per annum, and it holds an important position in domestic heating markets used in about 14 million homes worldwide is also used extensively in cooking as a non-greenhouse gas refrigerant and also as an Aerosol propellant there are commercial technologies out. There neste, for example, have developed an energy-intensive chemical process for conversion of bio-based glycerol to propane, but as yet a true biological route to lpg uh has not yet been commercialized. Now lpg is an excellent fuel. There are low energy costs required for its liquefaction, it's easily transported and it's a non-greenhouse gas and therefore it compares favorably to other alkane gas fuels such as methane, which is a major greenhouse gas produced from traditional, anaerobic digestion plants. So all this combines to make lpg. I think an attractive target for production using microbial cell factories and that's uh the journey that we set out uh to uh to follow uh over the last seven or eight uh, seven or eight years now, in thinking about this, i actually think it's it's it's. It'S worth really reflecting on what is the end product? What do we want to achieve here so that we can uh begin to uh think about how we can design the biology to fit the end game as it were? So this is my forward thinking slide. We need to ask what a bio lpg production plant might look like on the long term, so the engineering and process characteristics and overall economics of setting up and running such a plant can be fed back into early stage microbial strain engineering to ensure that the biology Is aligned with the larger scale engineering challenges? Consequently, we've taken a sort of bottom-up systems. Engineering approach to inform the overall design. Clearly, feed supply is central. We need to be able to target, for example, carbon dioxide or industrial wastes, or perhaps agricultural food and biomass waste, which are in plentiful supply. In the uk we shouldn't be reliant on fresh water, which is potentially scarce in certain regions of the world and also adds an initial cost burden in terms of the operation of such a plant. So our processes therefore need to run on sea, water or brackish water. We want to use them out in the field we need to obtain uh, we need to uh, we need to be clean and carbon neutral, uh, bio, lpg as unexplained is a clean burning fuel and distributed manufacturer for local use, would certainly minimize transportation costs and further Carbon burden, we also require simple, downstream processing to mitigate against major costs. So by embedding uh production into the existing infrastructures for production transport, we we essentially have a drop-in solution. We need to tailor to different waste streams, so we can be used effectively across the globe and there needs to be a low, capex and opex burden across the supply chain for its production, use and transport. So these are the sort of guiding principles that we're clearly thinking about in terms of developing a biological process for lpg production. So, let's return to the basic science. First of all, we need to develop a biological route to propane propane is not produced in nature. So there's no existing natural pathways or enzymes that can be repurposed for its scale for for large scale production, and so our early inroads were therefore to design new metabolic pathways for its production and to source and engineer enzymes. That could use a biologically sourced metabolite and turn that into propane gas. So using the dbtl type principle, we created a new version of the clostridial fermentation pathway to butanol, but crucially, adapted it to include newly discovered enzyme, aldehyde d, formulating oxygenase or ado as it's labeled, and you can see that in blue on the on the right hand. Panel at the bottom - and we set about to engineer this to work with short chain aldehyde substrates such as butyraldehyde. Our first target host was e coli because it's of ease and speed of genetic manipulation, as we've shown in the previous stress test, with our material monomers. But with a view that any prototypical pathway discovered could then be transferred to a more robust industrial host that could be used effectively out in the field and so the general approach. The early approach is summarized here: we selected a number of known by catalysts for each individual step in the conceptual metabolic pathways to propane and synthesize the dna to encode these and assemble them into plasma encoded pathways in a modular fashion using different plasmid combinations. We then explore alternative routes along the pathway, as identified by the hatched ellipses shown here, as well as using biocatalysts supplied by nature. We also had to repurpose selected catalysts to improve the target chemistry, especially for the ado enzyme, which is a slow enzyme that works best with long chain aldehydes and having assembled these early pathways, we then set out to optimize by switching in and switching out, new variants Or by eliminating competing pathways through targeted knockout of genes to ensure we direct metabolites to the desired uh product propane, so repurposing of adio by protein engineering was the first challenge. The enzyme works best with long chain aldehydes and to get a molecular view of this uh and how the substrate sits. We solve the crystal structure of ado uh in the presence of its surrogate ligand palmitic acid, which co-fur purifies with the enzyme from e coli, and here you can see that the substrate ax accesses the active site uh through a long hydrophobic channel with the carboxyl group. Uh being presented to the diane center, which is the the area uh of uh uh of catalysis, we conjectured the steric blocking of this channel, would exclude long chain substrates and perhaps favor the binding of short chain aldehydes. So a number of single or multiple mutations were made, the most effective being the replacement of a residue alanine 134 for alanine. You can see that in the slide here you can see the red algae side chain blocking off that channel and the structure of that variant indicated. The design intentions were carried through in crystal structures with shorter chain substrates. We then introduced the n, the engineered enzymes into plasmic constructs where we had assembled parts of the pathway genes leading uh from the cell metabolite acetyl coa through to the final product propane fermentation of a 12-hour period, analytical scale. That indicated that in fact, propane was now generated using this pathway, all beating relatively small amounts, but despite the low titers, this was the first clustering clostridium-like fermentation pathway shown to produce propane gas, and it establishes an important proof of concept. The titer is dependent on the metabolic root, followed, as indicated by the red and the green bars beyond these uh proof of prompt uh concept. Studies at lab scale, exploratory, five and four hundred liter scales have also been demonstrated. Uh and the low titra is clearly a challenge in part due to the very low activity of ado we've engaged in both direct evolution and rational engineering studies of ado. But improvements in catalytic activity here are hard-won and hindered by the fact that we're still unsure what is limiting in the overall catalytic cycle of this intriguing enzyme. So on this slide, you can visualize uh an air lift fermenter that we developed in c3 biotech the spin-out company to investigate early scale, up challenges of of propane production. Using the engineer, coalite strains that we produced e coli is supported using glycerol from a reprocessing plant from this movie, which i i hope works on screen here. Let me just generate, i guess it might not work, because i can't access my cursor. Oh there. It is uh from this movie here you cannot. Oh i'm not sure it's going to work. Oh there, it is, you can actually see a mixture of propane and other flammable gases burning from this deadly fermenter. There is propane in there it's not entirely propane. It'S a mixture of other flammable gases as well, but this really does at least demonstrate a proof of concept that propane can produce uh to some extent uh in this larger scale, uh fermented. There are uh challenges here, uh. Clearly, this is not a system that we would want to uh scale up this at this stage, uh because of uh the low titus produced uh, the cost of of of setting up sterile fermentations uh. We with e coli and many of the engineering challenges that we set out and in the end we have decided that, in fact, ado is probably not the ideal enzyme to be supporting uh short-chain alkane production in in microbial cell factories. So, armed with uh that knowledge uh that ado isn't likely to support this large-scale production in mib uh. A number of us uh in in the institute have been looking at other potential uh uh enzymes that could give rise to flammable fuels. For example, we've had a an mib-wide program on mechanism and structure of a number of enzymes, which can be used to produce alkenes, alkanes and indeed terpene fuels that i've mentioned briefly. Some of those enzymes are shown here, but really the game changer for us was the report in science in 2017 of a new photo enzyme isolated from algae, which using blue light, can decarboxylate long chain fatty acids into shorter to short chain alkanes. So, within that uh paper in science, the structure of the enzyme was reported by uh, sorry ital, and it's provided the the required insight into long chain fatty acid binding in the active site clef that could be targeted for rational design, uh towards substrates a notional catalytic Cycle was also presented by these authors involving fad photochemistry to decal oxalate, the fatty acid, using excited state, flavon chemistry and, as part of the characterization of the enzyme, we've done further spectroscopic analyses of this particular catalyst to determine its overall reaction mechanism. These studies were reported recently in acs catalysis earlier this year. In brief, we were able to demonstrate uh that a red intermediate is formed even under cryogenic conditions, uh, that's below the glass phase, transition of proteins, implying that the chemical change is not dependent on larger scale. Protein motion, but the decay of that red intermediate is very much dependent on protein structural change, because that only happens at temperatures above the glass phase transition. I won't dwell on those studies today. The paper is there: if anyone's interested to follow up, we were also able using laser excitation experiments to uh look at uh proton transfer and hydrogen transfer reactions associated uh with the formation decay of that red intermediate and we're able to begin to deconstruct the overall reaction. Uh mechanism and proton transfer pathways and indeed identify uh key residues in the active site, and i point you to the cysteine residue system 432 that we showed is involved in formation decay of that particular red intermediate. What that means is that we've been able to advance now our understanding of the overall reaction mechanism. First of all, this conserves cysteine residue is found in all fat fat analogues. Fap homologs are shown in the sequence alignment here, emphasizing its potential importance of the photochemistry uh. That cysteine is close uh to the fad cofactor and we believe it gets involved in the chemistry uh through a series of hydrogen transfer and electron transfer reactions. Uh. Essentially, what happens is that following flavon excitation, we then get a homolytic fission of the carbon-carbon bond on the substrate to form co2 and an alkane radical, and that alkane radical is then satisfied by h. Atom transfer from this active site sustain to form a phylate radical species which can translate form an interaction with the fad, that's the rare intermediate and then relax back to the resting form of the enzyme. So, on with this knowledge, we now have a clear understanding of mechanism, and this can be factored into rational engineering of the enzyme specificity. Our strategy is shown here, of course, in classical anaerobic digestion, type processes or indeed other processes derived from widely available biomass. You can get volatile fatty acid streams. We can then think about decarboxylating those volatile fatty acids using a single enzymatic step using the photo d-cap oxalates to form propane, isobutane and butane. So our overall strategy was to go in that particular direction. Uh but of course uh. The the fatty acid photo d-carboxylase predominantly works with long chain aldehydes, and our first challenge was really to try and reprofile if you like, the specificity of that enzyme, uh to work uh with uh with with shorter chain uh with shorter chain fatty acids. So we created a series of mutant, constructs, uh, informed by uh the structure uh, and you can see on this uh sequence window here we're able to identify residues which are involved uh in redefining, if you like, the the substrate specificity of this enzyme, we've generated many Uh variants of uh off of fap in an extensive mutagenesis cycle, some are single substitutions or there are multiple substitutions uh, but we've been able to sort of uh. If you like, i identify a sequence window where key changes. Uh can really uh alter the uh specificity. Uh of um, or or of this enzyme for short chain uh for short chain, uh, uh, volatile fatty acids - and we can see some of the screening outputs here. So here we now have variants which are able to work with both c3 and c4 hydrocarbon fatty acids and indeed c3c4 hydrocarbon blends - that's important because wherever you are in the world of course, lpg comprises propane, butane or other short chains, and you might want to fine-tune The lpg content, depending on uh the type of uh of uh fap enzyme, uh, that that is using the microbial cell factory now previously i'd mentioned uh that uh most of our prototype work has been done in uh in in e coli uh. But really we need to translate that then into uh into a more robust um uh robust industrial host, so conventional fermentations are clearly very costly, both in terms of capex investments and ongoing opex running costs and fermentation typically uses extensive, expensive steel fermenters with monitoring systems. It requires aeration, mixing and dsp uh sterilization costs and, of course, uh extensive use of fresh water, fresh water water. So we have a strong collaboration with george chen in chingua university in beijing and george is the sort of world leader in terms of using uh extrema files or hello files as as hosts for next generation by technology. And we work with george in recent years to if you like, translate much of our chemicals pathways into uh halophilic hosts and the beauty of that is that halomonas uh can use low-cost reactors. We don't need uh sterilization, because the high selenite negates sterilization processes. These strains will grow on sea water. They will use simple waste carbon sources as as growth feed stocks, they're genetically tractable and uh. It'S already demonstrated to be in an existing, robust industrial host. So our early lab scale work looked at propane production with both clean and crude biodiesel media, and you can see that on the slide here and we've been able to show production of propane inhale among us, as indicated in the top uh right hand, uh panel uh And, what's more if the variant enzymes are introduced into uh? Well, this is just a further a further description of what i've just described here you can see uh. The performance here is actually much improved above what we see uh using our e coli host, our highest uh, published propane levels, are around about 0.2 grams per liter of culture. Halomonas has got a high tolerance to the substrate we use for this photocatalytic conversion uh. We can get growth in non-sterile, seawater, uh and and so on, and so forth. All the characteristics that you'd want to uh see beginning to emerge out of this, this new uh this new platform. What'S more uh we can uh if we, if we place the variant enzymes into a photosynthetic organism such as cynical cystis uh, we can also demonstrate propane production from co2 feedstocks. This therefore opens up the exciting possibility of making gasoline hydrocarbon fuels from co2s the titers. In this case are lower than what we see in halomonus is clearly rounds of optimization to be done here, but again we establish an important uh proof of proof of concept uh for further development of making fuels uh from co2. So what i hope i've done is to give you uh a flavor of the type of trajectory that we're pursuing both academically, uh and and in our open access sort of uh commercial ventures. Uh. The sort of work that we're doing clearly is much more happening. That'S commercially sensitive in the company that i can't talk about to today, but what we have done is to demonstrate proof of concept for bio lpg production using engineered microbial cell factories. Uh we've performed techno economics in lca to inform roots to scale production based on these foundational strains and c3. Biotech is now engaged in experimental pilot plant developments to guide scale up and to feed back into further iterations of strain engineering uh to ultimately impact on the economics and productivity of production. I'M conscious i've probably gone over my time slightly, so i think that is where i will finish, but before i do that. I'D like to finish by really thanking many researchers who've contributed to the research programs. I'Ve discussed today. Our funding from various agencies, in particular, i'd like to thank the staff in symbia kent center at manchester, who done a lot of the strain automation of the strain engineering, but also the future brh, which is a second center. That'S needed risking much of the scale up work and then people in my own research group who've really pushed the lpg type work, but also important collaborators. We'Ve worked with patrick jones at imperial college, on this project in the early stages and and indeed in some of the cinema, sisters, work and also uh. My good collaborator in beijing, george, chen uh, with whom we've been doing uh much of the work with one halemona's funders, are, of course uh ukri, but increasingly we have industry funded programs coming from c3 biotech. That'S where i'll finish, and i'm certainly happy to take any questions if people have them. Thank you um. Thank you very much, nigel for a really excellent talk, a really thought-provoking talk as well um, especially for me, who's more sort of inorganic engineer than than bio. Um. Really fascinating, we do have a couple of questions already popping up on the the questions. Um maria asks um or says it's an amazing example of targeted engineering of nature um, but you'd like to know about the economical viability of the process. Yeah the estimation of such price of the price of such a product, and do you need to purify due to lesser activity and, what's the most expensive in the dbtl cycle, yeah? Okay, both of those are excellent questions. We we've done quite a lot of early-stage techno-economic uh analysis uh, particularly for the bio lpg, and you could imagine there. We'Ve got a real challenge. Lpg is not that expensive, uh and so to have a process. That'S competitive with with with existing manufacturing processes is uh. Is going to be a significant challenge? The answer here, i think uh is uh. A micro microbial cell factory, just making propane alone or making lpg alone is not, is not going to compete with cost, but the way forward, i think, is to take an a sort of more integrated by refinery type approach, but symbify that approach. What i mean by that is to take your your chassis that makes uh lpg and also have it to make multiple other products, and we've looked at that in detail in our published paper that came out uh earlier this year, where we've got different case scenarios. We'Ve done the techno economics and the lca and other types of approach for up to 10 or 11 different case studies. And as you follow through those case studies, then you can see that you can really bring the cost of manufacture down to the point where it becomes uh, in our view, economically, a viable proposition and that's the approach we're taking in the company and and also the Approach that's been used to feed back into further engineering of the strains. Uh second part of the question i think was to do with the right missing step in dbtl was that was that the? What was the most expensive step in the db uh gosh? I think the most expensive step is staff resource, if i'm brutally honest and the capital investment is setting up the platform uh in terms of consumable running costs. I think that's really hard to to deconstruct. I i think uh, you know, as you can imagine, a platform of this type takes a lot of expensive equipment and just running and maintaining you know, multiple mass spectrometers, robotics so on and so forth is a constant manager's nightmare in terms of finding money to make Sure that that that that is kept up and working uh, so actually, i think that's where the the real the real cost is that and staff resource, um, consumable costs and time um, perhaps less so. Thank you. I hope that answers your question. Maria stephen wallace would like to ask um. I thank you for a great talk and says he was just wondering how photo active your d. Carboxylase is when it's inside a cell and also inside a fermenter yeah. That'S a really good question too, because, as you know, the challenge we have with any photo active system is like penetration into the cells and that's going to be an engineering challenge. Moving forward, uh we're aware of that. We'Ve done some scoping experiments on lab scale to try and try and tackle with that. Certainly in a lab scale, fermenter one liter half a liter we can. We can show that we can drive the reaction in live cells. The problem of working with the photobiocatalyst is that in the excited state, the enzymes pretty unstable, uh, the the chemistry is, is reactive chemistry. So actually your enzyme undergoes inactivation pretty quickly, even in a live cell. So you have to constantly regenerate your your biomass to recover the catalyst it's a bit like you do in the chemical industry. You make a catalyst that gets poisoned. You'Ve got to remake it. The good thing about biology is remaking. That catalyst is not that expensive. You just regrow the bugs, so there are a number of issues we have to. We have to deal with here. Light penetration is one we're generating catalyst, as the other. Thank you and stephen also asks. What do you think the future role of traditional synthetic chemists will be as strain engineering becomes more and more routine and we gradually move away from petrochemicals? Well, i got ta be careful. What i say here you can probably tell by i i'm passionate about you know what the role for by founders is, but it's complementary to what we, what we achieve uh using conventional uh synthetic approaches, there'll always be chemistry that biology can't do uh, but there might Also be chemistry that biology do that chemistry can't do so. You know i really see this as a twin track approach really and getting a closer tie into developing uh programs or processes in which synthetic biology uh is part of the is part of the journey. I think is an important thing. Let me give you an example: synthetic biology is really good at making carbon scaffolds. As i showed you today, terpene scaffolds, tailoring the scaffolds through very precise, oxy, functionalization or or further additions might either be a synthetic chemistry challenge or it might be a sort of whole cell or purified biocatalysis type. The sort of thing we do in the uk by catalysis sort of theme of the of the catalysis hub, so i don't think any of these things are exclusive. They have to be integrated as part of a sort of hybrid work stream moving forward, but i think symbian can certainly make uh scaffolds very effectively and cheaply. Hope that answers your question. Stephen um cooles says grants karen sorry. I pronounced that really badly. I'M sure um asks: did you manage to ex express difficult to express membrane-bound, cytochrome p450 enzymes in e coli, which are part of these processes? So we stayed away from membrane-bound sort of more mammalian-type eukaryotic p-450s, and we - and everyone knows who works on p450s - that that working with membrane-bound systems is is is a bit of a nightmare uh and in fact, probably one of the reasons why p-450s are not widely Exploited in in conventional industrial black catalysis, we tend to concentrate on uh, mutants and variant forms of bacterial systems, which are well characterized p450 cam p450bn3, those sort of enzymes. There are many variants now available from labs all over the world and that's the that's. The sort of repository of enzymes that we used uh for the basis of that work, um. Having said it, we were able to find catalysts that that could really oxy functionalize at all different positions of of the terpenes that we that we discussed um bill stibbs would like to know. Is there a market for bio-based short-chain fatty acids? Uh i'd like to know that, for obvious reasons, and if anyone knows a market for short-chain, smelly, uh, volatile acids, uh, then please, let me know, drop me. An email i'd be delighted to hear from you. I'M sure there is uh but uh. I don't quite know the details of that. So, if anyone's got any insight, please let me know: okay, you and mcdonald would like uh. Thank you for the talk and ask um. Is there a place for multi-species-strained communities of bacteria to improve stability and synergy and mitigate species, strain specific weaknesses for large-scale fermentation biosynthesis, as opposed to string the singular strains such as the dbt cycles? I i think the answer that is is yes, very likely, very probably for a variety of reasons. Uh shuttling, intermediates out of one uh or first of all, getting a complex metabolic pathway to work in a single host is, is probably quite difficult. There'S a real challenge in terms of the engineering of biology that you have to do, making two smaller strains that communicate with each other to perhaps uh share the products of one as a substrate for another uh is is an obvious strategy. There are many other strategies that that might require you to work with multiple uh organisms uh. So, in short, yes uh, i could probably talk for another half hour on the sort of application areas where that might be the case. I'M probably not appropriate for today, but certainly yes, i think multi multi cultures are are are are certainly on. The cards um mohammed javed would like to know, does are terpenes produced in the engineered e coli with growth, or is it produced as a secondary metabolite? In the stationary phase, yeah um yeah uh - i don't have hard data to show you on that, but uh, certainly in early stages of growth. Uh. A lot of the strategies we use in the lab are classical sort of what the molecular biologists would know. Get your biomass up and then induce uh and switch on your chemistry, uh yeah. I think at an academic level. That'S what we would do uh, so you tend to sort of get production toward the end of the growth cycle when you're approaching station phase. Clearly, in a more industrial context, where you don't want to be using inducible promoters, you might be working off more constitutive promoters that don't require induction. You might have a different regime. Many of these compounds, however cytotoxic so you've also got to get that balance right as well. You don't want to make it too early so that you, you start interfering with your biomass accumulation. So it's a bit of a fine balancing act, if i'm honest and we're exploring many of those uh different regimes, uh in in some of the scaling work that we're doing. He does ask what is the yield gram per gram per sub uh gram per gram of substrate uh? I do well again depends which product you're talking about [ Laughter ]. So i i i don't have that data for for the terpene prototype pathways uh, mainly because we haven't determined that accurately. I think these are prototype strains the ones i talked about today. We have to go through optimization processes before we start looking at stoichiometris of conversion. We have done that sort of work for our lpg work. I'M not sure i want to sort of share some of that data with you at this stage, because there's some commercial sensitivity, but we we have done some of that work with some of our adapter strains. We have an anonymous question, which is: will such synthetic biology synthesized substances get rejected by the public in the same manner as gmos? If so, how can we convince people? Well, the hope is not uh and the lesson has to be learned and, of course, when student, anabolic research councils and other funding came into this from the government injection in 2014-13, then that was clearly very much on the on the agenda and research councils. Quite rightly, uh were determined that that conversation should happen early on, so that we could de-risk uh the acceptability of the engineering that we're doing uh within the centers. So, in the manchester center we we we have great leadership in this space from uh someone called phil shapiro, who has driven really quite a lot of the uh responsible research innovation work in the center and and offers some leadership nationally in that as well uh. We hope that those sort of conversations will will prevent another gmo uh situation backfiring on the on the symbio world um. Thank you, chris newman. Thanks for your talk and asks, how far away are you from a commercial production of a mono 13, i can't tell you that i'm afraid too sensitive um watch this space, [ Laughter, ], sorry, chris, adam winifreuth asks um. Oh so he's a biochemistry undergraduate and was wondering what skills you would encourage um for him to learn. If you wanted to get involved in bioengineering, that's a tough one, and i think you know there's a lot of skills. I mean it really is. Truly. Is an interdisciplinary challenge and it's exciting for pg students who want to sort of work in this space. But you know you really have to sort of be agile and you've got to be prepared to sort of jump into the deep end i mean. I know i trained as an enzymologist, but you know i don't know where i am these days and some some would say a jack of all trades master of none. That'S probably quite right, uh, because you know we we dabble in so much different stuff and - and i think you have to do as a synthetic biology you have to do some of the you know the computational design work. You'Ve got to do the analytical chemistry, the strain engineering, the underpinning molecular biology, uh, there's lots of conventional chemistry involved as well. It'S a it's. It'S a big ask for any anybody, uh training. So i would say you know, look around at the training opportunities that you have. We think we do pretty well in the mib, i'm sure the centers. Do it equally. Well, it's just that. You know you need to find that sort of environment that supports it. Yeah um there was an understood from chris newman um govind, sorry gavin says, is indeed a good host for phb was further path. Was the pathway further engineered for diverting flux from phb to propane? Also, sorry, i missed how you store the propane in the lab environment. Thank you yeah, so i can't tell you anything about the details of the engineering because again, there's there's sensitivities, i'm afraid in that process i apologize for not being able to give details. Recovering propane from life cell bioreactors is relatively straightforward. Of course it's the gas. So you don't have the same problem you have with other biofuels, which are either stuck in the cell or stuck in the liquid of the reactor. It comes off as a gas, so you can just do simple, liquefaction uh, it's standard technology in the propane industry. My business partner he's in the propane industry. He knows how to do that. So we have an instant network of expertise that we can draw on to to help us. Do it. Okay and jordy asks um. Is there any opportunity to make more valuable bio products upstream from propane, for example, acrylic acid in principle? Yes, uh, you know as academics, of course, we're looking to derive value from existing pathways that we have in our center symbiote cam and indeed in future brh. A lot of the sort of initial pathways that we've developed we're looking to derive value from them by you know we call them our gateway pathways because they open up then roots to to other close by chemicals of value um. So we've done this recently with flavonoids. For example, or an initial entry pathway, there was elaborated further to make. You know different types of flavonoids, so yes in principle, absolutely there's there's always that opportunity and it's relatively straightforward to do that. Well, i think you can tell from the the width of the questioning it was a very well received talk um. I think we've come to the end of the questions now. Um, i'm sure all the participants are clapping at their screens and saying. Thank you very much for such a inspiring talk and i'd like to say. Thank you very much for giving up your time to give us this talk. It'S been excellent. Thank you very much. It'S been a pleasure. I'Ve enjoyed it and i hope people have got something to take away with them. So thank you very much for inviting me. Thank you very much. Okay, goodbye everyone. Thank you for joining us um. I hope see you next month for our next webinar and lots of thanks on the chat. Okay, i will end the meeting and the recording will go up on the website once it's been processed. Okay, thanks \""

              "\"welcome everyone to the october installment of the task hub webinar series it's my very great pleasure to introduce fresh and nigel stratton from the manchester institute of biotechnology in manchester university who will be talking about microbial cell factor factories. Sorry, i've lost my ability to read an engineering biology for chemical production. I will hand straight over to nigel, but if you could use the q a function to ask questions and we will answer all the questions at the end, if you have any technical difficulties or any issues or would like to introduce yourself and let us know where You'Re from please use the chat button and, on that i'll hand straight over to professor scrotum, okay. Thank you very much. Thanks for a very kind introduction,it's a pleasure to be with you all this afternoon and for me to be able to tell you about our recent work on engineering biology for chemicals, production and biomanufacturing. So what i'd like to do today is to discuss our work on establish, establishing an automated biofoundry for microbial strain engineering and the impact that this is having on chemicals and fuels production and then how some of this work is now being translated to scale for the Commercial production of selected, advanced fuels so really just to provide some context. Of course, by manufacturing is a significant contributor to the uk economy and we're now on the cusp, i think, of rapid expansion of this sector, as we urgently try to find solutions to meetglobal challenges. For example, the government's clean growth and zero carbongenders - and this is especially important - i think in the uk chemicals manufacturing sector, which includes over 3 000 businesses employing around about 153 000 people and giving something like 19 billion in gross value added to a turnover Around about 55 billion, so of course the majority of this comes from petrochemicals a fact: that's increasingly odds with the paris agreement, obligations and and 80 reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. So clearly and urgently, we need to change and transition to a more sustainable biomanufacturing sector as part of the uk's economic recovery, as we build back better following the global pandemic. Now, of course, the uk is recognized as a world leader in in biotechnology, and this is especially true in the research base which delivers first rate discovery. Science. The uk, however, needs to do better at building back from this science base to implement sustainable biomanufacturing technologies and bring them to market, and i guess pre-pandemic - the uk produced multiple roadmaps. Many of them. You see on the slide here and vision documents to shape future investment. In infrastructure, training and science and technology programs to rapidly grow the industrial biotechnology base, and so i guess there's no better time than now to capitalize on these developments, especially as we approach the next u.n climate change conference in glasgow in 2021. As we aim to build back better through clean growth, so what i hope to convince you of this afternoon is that at the mib or the manchester institute of biotechnology we're developing a research environment to tackle the science and technology challenges of establishing a buy-based manufacturing economy. Especially in the areas of fuels and and chemicals, and over the years, mib has assembled a strong interdisciplinary research community, working together across the biology chemistry, materials, engineering and computational science areas, uh. That really has enabled us to address ambitious challenge-led research programs and of course, we were delighted to be recognized earlier this year through the award of the queen's anniversary prize recognizing mib's leadership in the uk's strategic development of biotechnology and by manufacturing through innovative technologies and partnerships. With industry now in mib, what we've done is to assemble a number of capability platforms that have often been supported by major investments from ukrai and industry, and these are provided focal points for the development of new technology platforms, for engineering biology and for forming interactions. With external groups and industry to help pull through academic discoveries towards industrial application, what i want to do today is focus on two key research areas: synthetic biology and biocatalysis, but also supported by work. We'Ve been doing in the structural and biophysic analysis of enzyme systems, so in 2014 we established symbiotic m one of thesixsynthetic biology research, centerssupported by the bbsrc as a platform center for the rapid engineering of microbial strains for fine and specialty Chemicals based on a bespoke design-built, tesla and platform that we've developed within the center, the chemicals production pipeline, starts at the design stage shown in purple here, where we set out blueprints for engineered microbial strains using a suite of design algorithms for rapid strain engineering. These include design tools for retrosynthesis in the cell and the design of extended metabolic pathways to access new chemical space and enzyme selection and engineering tools. We can then design and select dna parts, combine them into plasmid libraries using automated assembly instructions and high throughput robotics, and the build stage then prepares us for the assembly of these genetically encoded parts and assembles them into plasmids via, for example, ligase cycling reactions according to Automatically generated work, lists that drive the laboratory, automation and the fidelity of the assembled pathways is then checked, for example, by high throughput restriction, analysis and capillary electrophoresis or by nanopore dna sync sequencing, and then the test stage encompasses high throughput methods for the growth of microbialproduction, cultures, automated product extraction and screening via fast liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. The results are analyzed in the learn stage of the blue shaded panel on the slide, through predictive models using statistical methods of machine learning to inform the next round of design. And after a number of iterations of this dbtl cycle, successful prototypes are then taken forward to process development and scale up, and so in establishing the sim by chem pipeline. We set out really to achieve a number of objectives. First of all, the pipeline should be agnostic to the target compound that we want to produce and also to a certain extent, to the host bacterial organism, so that we can support the production of many different chemicals from different host organisms. Secondly, it should leverage high throughput automation to ensure rapid delivery of new strains, and this improved performance should also reduce human error in the engineering programmes. Third, we set out to provide software platforms and expertise that could then be readily adopted by the wider synthetic biology community. Now development of the symbiofoundry concept was really phased in phase, one that we focus very much on developing the underpinning capabilities of the pipeline around threetarget groups of compounds, those being flavonoids terpenes and alkaloids as exemplar groups, and then in the second phase. We then tested the pipeline in anger, carrying out a stress test to determine how many materials monomers, for example, that we could produce from biology in a three-month window using the symbiocan capabilities. So, in the first stress test, we set ourselves the challenge of seeing how many materials monomers we could produce by engineering e coli using the pipeline and in discussions with local materials scientists. At manchester, we identified a list of monomer targets used widely by industry, and a selection of these targets from the list was chosen based on monomers that were either found in natural biosynthesis roots or ones that are biosynthetic by synthetically, accessible based on literature, information and prospective Bioretrosynthetic research, we selected 25 targets encompassing seven compound classes that were either materials monomers or compound precursors. These encompassvinyl, benzenes, alloy, benzenes, mandalas, isobutyl compounds, diols, dienes and carboxylates, each with our own application areas in polymer chemistry. We then set ourselves a notional 90-day limit to walk through the design, build test and learn cycle to identify how many unique strains capable of synthesizing. These products could be engineered and also to characterize general properties, such as the titers of products in laboratory fermentations, and to identify potential strains that could enter a second dbtl cycle, focus this time on optimizing titers to reach gram per liter levels suitable for large scale production. So for each class of chemical target, new synthetic metabolic pathways were selected following the symbiocam automated approach, which involved the use of retrosynthesis software enzyme. Candidates for each step were selected using our design, algorithm cell enzyme and via phylogenetic analysis and the target compounds and prime metabolite precursors are represented here,by skeletal formula, whilst other e coli metabolites are represented by abbreviations. Now the continuous arrows on the on the slide represent a single enzyme step, whereas successive arrows represent multiple enzymatic transformationstoward the target compound. So targets successfully produced in the e coli are shown in green. Those in red were from the original target list, but for which enzymatic roots to their production were not found. Orange targets were produced enzymatically in vitro, but not during fermentation of e coli and the blue structures identified compounds for which the title was raised substantially by engineering e coli, for example, by knocking out competing pathways or by boosting expression of biocatalyst in the cell through further Rounds of strain engineering, the entire dbtl engineering cycle was completed in automated fashion within 85 days. The success of the rapid design and then the engineering of new bacterial strains reveals the power that we believe of the prototyping strategy of the biofoundry approach in discovering new pathways. That can lead to chemical space, not naturally found in biology. We subsequently took a small selection of these strains that have been engineered to produce mandalay and hydroxymandulate and put them through a second stress test, with the objective of increasing titers to the gram per liter scale. That second stress test was likewise successful, driving titus into the one to ten gram per liter scale, values that are now suitable for consideration of production scale up for these compounds. So if we look at the outcome of the stress test is a simple numbers gallery, we can get a feel for the capabilities of the constructor pipeline within the 85-day limit. We designed and created 160 unique genetic parts by dna synthesis we constructed and verified by sequencing. 187, unique pathway constructs assembled using our automated ligacycline reaction methods. We performed over 150 unique enzyme, assays created nine mutant e coli chassis, using, for example, genome engineering methods that we analyze more than 8 000 samples using mass spectrometry as part of the integrated test platform, and we developed 22 new ms quantification methods. The outcome is that from a standing standing starting point, we created prototype strains for 17 out of the original 25 monomers of interest and we were able to access biologically five out of seven classes of identified monomer types. So, overall, we estimate that the personnel and consumable costs amounted to around about fifteen thousand pounds per successful target, corresponding to 360 personnel hours per compound. And this rigorous and comprehensive benchmarking study. We feel now showcases the ability of body foundries to provide quick and affordable access to a diverse range of chemicals by microbial fermentation and how these early prototype strains can now be optimized and scaled up to achieve grampalito fermentation as the basis for large-scale production. So we've also been interested in exploring biological diversity and chemical diversity using the the biofoundryapproach, and for some time now, we've been exploring terpene chemistry as an attractive playground for microbial chemicals production, as the terpenes group is naturally very diverse. With up to around about 80 000 known compounds in nature, in the interest of focusing on the subset of these compounds, we concentrated on the mono terpenes, which are c10 compounds made from the isopronate precursors, isopentanol, diphosphate and dimethylal diphosphate. Now many of these molar terpenes have major industrial applications and are used widely, for example, as flavourings fragrances and antiseptics, and are also important precursors for pharmaceuticals, bioplastics and fuels currently they're obtained from either agricultural sources, which are subject to seasonalvariation, crop yields and use Land that, frankly, could be better repurposed for, for example, for producing food or they're synthesized chemically, which in itself is a challenge given their overall complex structures and the existence of multiple stereocenters, and this dries up the cost of production and purification of the desired products. So we set out to discover if compounds of this type could be made readily using synthetic biology and to create a plug-and-play microbial prototype strain that could produce a vast array of terpenes and if successful, we were then interested to see if selected strains could be optimized. Further to support production at scale, so during the early development phases of the symbiote chem pipeline, we we focused on three chemical groups, as i said previously, terpenes, flavonoids and alkaloids. Our first demonstration of the pipeline with flavonoids and alkaloids was published in 2018 prior to the material stress test that i mentioned earlier. The terpene work has been progressing over an extended timeline to build up a series of strains and genetically encoded parts to make a vast array of terpenes in engineered microbial strains, some of which are currently being scaled for specific applications within the with industry partners and again. What i hope to do is to convince you that the biofounders and the engineering of biology provide attractive alternative routes to the production of a range of industrially, important chemicals and also potentially expand the chemical reach beyond that easily attainable using synthetic chemistry methods. So on this slide, i i call thisimage the monoterpene wheel. It indicates the skeletal structures of all monoterpene scaffolds derived from the precursor isoprenoid shown at the bottom of the the bottom of the wheel shown here. We can identify three subgroups, the bicyclic monoterpenes, the monocyclic and the acyclic monoterpenes, and our objective was to engineer prototype strains that could make each of these compounds as a basis for further optimization and ultimately scale up for production. The first task was to engineer the feeder pathway that gives rise to common substrates for all these terpenes. That'S geranyl diphosphate. We and others have created such pathways using variants of the so-called endogenous mep pathways, which generally results in low intracellular levels of the isoprene precursors or using a heterologous mva pathway that we have created and optimized in recent years to balance carbon flux and stability when contained In a heterologous host after synthesizing these pathways for progressive supply, our objective was then to introduce a library of monoterpene cyclases into the host strain, using a plug-and-play approach to switch on the synthesis of the desired monoterpene product. Now, initially, we targetedtwo to three known plant terpene cyclases, for each individual scaffold taken from a diverse source of a diverse source of different plants in the hope of detecting and quantifying the monoterpene product produced from the engineer's trains. This then opens up additional dptl engineering, for example, to optimize product titers, minimize cytotoxicity of the products and enable tailoring of the scaffolds to makehigher higher value products. So early designs were relatively straightforward. We set up a two plasmid system with the feeder pathways contained in a single plasma shown here and with a second plasmid containing journal diphosphate. The entry enzyme that is required to form gdp on which the terpene cyclase can can then act switched in and out of different terpene. Cyclase enzymes then enables production of different target monoterpenes to be studied. The mva feeder pathways were engineered and optimized using enzymes taken from multiple organisms, color coded as shown as shown here and fine-tuning of metabolic flux. Through this, engineered mva pathway was also achieved through machine learning to affect translational tuning of individual genes using libras as synthetic ribosome binding sites to boost production titus by over 60 when screening under three percent of a ribosome binding site library to facilitate library, screening a multi-wellplate fermentation procedure was developed, allowing increased screening throughout throughput with sufficient resolution to discriminate between high and low producers, and this early optimization has helped to balance the flux through the nva pathway and when, coupled with further engineering, has led to the production of stable and Optimized plasmid constructs for the production of the required isoprenoid precursors, so what we have achieved is the creation of a first generation library of e coli strains that can make every natural monoterpene scaffold represented in the so-called monoterpene wheel. This then gives us access to a generalized platform of e coli strains as a starting point for optimization for scale up and also for further chemical tailoring and to facilitate talion. We also generated an extensive biocatalysis toolkit for the oxy functionalization of terpenesby designing and building a cytochrome p450 enzyme collection and testing it in a custom-made, untargeted, gcms metabolomics, based approach, we're able to rapidly create and characterize a comprehensive library for the controlled oxyfunctionalization of Terpene scaffolds with a wide range of activities and selectivities towards all the monoterpene shown here. We can now use this novel by catalytic resource to access the extensive chemical diversity of terpenoids by further pathway engineering through the assembly of biocatalytic cascades to subsequently produce libraries of oxygenated terpenoids and their derivatives for diverse applications, for example, terpene-based drug discovery. So the outcome of the first generation engineering is shown here both in terms of product profiles and indeed titus achieved for each of the mod terpene scaffolds. We were able to produce more than 30 different monoterpenoids from glucose using 20 different terpene synthases. Several novel scaffolds were generated not previously produced in engineered microbes before and initial production levels were exceeded for mostwhere selected examples have been previously produced in engineered microbes. Most terpene synthases, however, produce a multiple products and, in particular, complex bicyclic products, where typically only 60 to 70 percent of the total terpene product is of the bicyclic type. Some compounds are produced at very low titers, as we can see here, and examples include targets that we were particularly interested in linoleum and terpinoli. What is striking overall is that the product prior profiles were generally very complex and multiple products were obtained with, with most cyclases or terpene synthases and a range of product titers were obtained. These were affected by many things: optimizing the pathway, flux, enzyme, expression, minimizing site, product formation and controlling the effects of cytotoxicity are all important factors in in in determining the the final title obtained uh. Moreover, engineering, individual terpene synthesis or finding alternative catalysts in nature to give cleaner products is clearly a priority for large-scale production of these compounds. Now the reasons for the complex product profiles are found really in the mechanistic details of the mode of action of terpene synthases. These enzymes initiate the reaction cascade by eliminating the diphosphate of geruno diphosphate shown on the left here,to form the gerund cation also shown here in the second, the second structure. On the slide. This then undergoes isomerization to form the linoleil and terminal cations and any point along the reaction k at cascade thesereactive enzyme intermediates can undergo further chemical reactions such as intramolecular attack on all filling double bonds hydride or protein migrations and rearrangements to change. The structure of the chemical staff scaffold, ultimately, the reactive intermediates are quenched by deprotonation or nucleophilic attack by water. Now, hydrophobic residues in the enzyme active site form this rather oily substrate binding pocket. I make the comparison here with an ice cream scoop and that we can mold the active site, but we really give it littlechemical identity to specifically position the substrate in the active site. This hydrophobic binding pocket protects the cationic intermediates from the undirected attack of water and aromatic residues stabilize the charged intermediates by cation pi interactions. Now these relatively inert active sites means it's very there's very little overall sequence, similarity between different terpene cyclases, with the exception of small fingerprint aspartate, rich sequence, motifs,close and and a second short motif, which is involved in binding the magnesium cofactors. This lack of overall sequence, identity really complicates any attempt at rational design and of the of these enzymes used in structure and sequence guided protein engineering. This is clearly a problem when one has the objective to really tighten up product profiles, for example, for the production of a cleanproduct in our microbial cell factories, and this is a major engineering challenge for this particular field. So, given the complex product profiles obtained with many of the natural plant terpene synthesis more recently, we switched our attention to mining terpene synthases from bacterial species and given the poor sequence conservation, the active site, we used a hidden mark of model, informatics search of bacterial genome Sequences to identify new terpene cyclase enzymes, using this approach, we've identified 2167 putative new bacterial terpene synthases, using the two fingerprint motifs. I discussed briefly on the previous slide and then we selected multiple examples and characterized their overall activityusing, for example, gcms type analyses most were shown to be sesquiterpine and diterpian synthases, and only a few were shown to be monoterpene synthases. That said, we have identified specific lineal and sineal terpene synthesis we've gone to determine their x-ray structures and product profiles and shown. These are in fact, far superior as catalysts for producing those compounds in in microbial cell factories compared to the plant enzymes. So we've shown that the bacterial enzymes are simpler in structure and, more importantly, give much more restrictive product profiles uh. As i say, the bacterial cynial and lineal terpene synthesis not only give cleaner product profiles but predominantly forma single productinlifestyle fermentations. It also enables much higher titus to be reached for these particular products in our plug-and-play platform, and this then enables us to begin to consider whether we can scale up some of these prototype strainsto produce these compounds that ground per liter levels. Okay. So what i hope i've done so far is to show thatthe biofoundry approach is, is certainly useful in rapidly generating prototypical strains uh. That can be then further optimized for larger scale fermentations, but also give you access to chemistry that may be difficult to access using conventional synthetic methods and therefore that really demonstrates the power of biologyin in rapidly generating a palette. If you like, of different chemical structures,from a commonfrom a common scaffold, what i'd like to do now is to change tack a little bit and show you how microbial cell factory engineering can also be used to make fuels from biology. We'Ve worked for the last seven or eight years and continue to do so on the production of liquefied petroleum gas or lpg from engineered microbial strains using fermentative and photocatalytic processes. This is a story. That'S gone from early strain development to large-scale production of bio-lpg at pilots. To demonstrate a scale, and in recent years, the establishment of a fields from biology company called c3 biotech that we established, which is currently scaling and commercializing our bio lpg production technologies. So the obvious question, first of all, is why target lpg? Well, first of all, it's a it's important to appreciate that lpg varies across the world, predominantly it comprises propane, but there are varying amounts of butane and other combustible gases present, depending on where you source the gas globally. In the uk, lpg is almost entirely propane in in composition, and its manufacturer is clearly from fossil sources. Now lpg is a very clean burning transport fuel currently around about 22 million tons per annum, and it holds an important position in domestic heating markets used in about 14 million homes worldwide is also used extensively in cooking as a non-greenhouse gas refrigerant and also as an Aerosol propellant there are commercial technologies out. There neste, for example, have developed an energy-intensive chemical process for conversion of bio-based glycerol to propane, but as yet a true biological route to lpghas not yet been commercialized. Now lpg is an excellent fuel. There are low energy costs required for its liquefaction, it's easily transported and it's a non-greenhouse gas and therefore it compares favorably to other alkane gas fuels such as methane, which is a major greenhouse gas produced from traditional, anaerobic digestion plants. So all this combines to make lpg. I think an attractive target for production using microbial cell factories and that'sthe journey that we set outtoto followover the last seven or eightseven or eight years now, in thinking about this, i actually think it's it's it's. It'S worth really reflecting on what is the end product? What do we want to achieve here so that we canbegin tothink about how we can design the biology to fit the end game as it were? So this is my forward thinking slide. We need to ask what a bio lpg production plant might look like on the long term, so the engineering and process characteristics and overall economics of setting up and running such a plant can be fed back into early stage microbial strain engineering to ensure that the biology Is aligned with the larger scale engineering challenges? Consequently, we've taken a sort of bottom-up systems. Engineering approach to inform the overall design. Clearly, feed supply is central. We need to be able to target, for example, carbon dioxide or industrial wastes, or perhaps agricultural food and biomass waste, which are in plentiful supply. In the uk we shouldn't be reliant on fresh water, which is potentially scarce in certain regions of the world and also adds an initial cost burden in terms of the operation of such a plant. So our processes therefore need to run on sea, water or brackish water. We want to use them out in the field we need to obtainwe need towe need to be clean and carbon neutral,bio, lpg as unexplained is a clean burning fuel and distributed manufacturer for local use, would certainly minimize transportation costs and further Carbon burden, we also require simple, downstream processing to mitigate against major costs. So by embeddingproduction into the existing infrastructures for production transport, we we essentially have a drop-in solution. We need to tailor to different waste streams, so we can be used effectively across the globe and there needs to be a low, capex and opex burden across the supply chain for its production, use and transport. So these are the sort of guiding principles that we're clearly thinking about in terms of developing a biological process for lpg production. So, let's return to the basic science. First of all, we need to develop a biological route to propane propane is not produced in nature. So there's no existing natural pathways or enzymes that can be repurposed for its scale for for large scale production, and so our early inroads were therefore to design new metabolic pathways for its production and to source and engineer enzymes. That could use a biologically sourced metabolite and turn that into propane gas. So using the dbtl type principle, we created a new version of the clostridial fermentation pathway to butanol, but crucially, adapted it to include newly discovered enzyme, aldehyde d, formulating oxygenase or ado as it's labeled, and you can see that in blue on the on the right hand. Panel at the bottom - and we set about to engineer this to work with short chain aldehyde substrates such as butyraldehyde. Our first target host was e coli because it's of ease and speed of genetic manipulation, as we've shown in the previous stress test, with our material monomers. But with a view that any prototypical pathway discovered could then be transferred to a more robust industrial host that could be used effectively out in the field and so the general approach. The early approach is summarized here: we selected a number of known by catalysts for each individual step in the conceptual metabolic pathways to propane and synthesize the dna to encode these and assemble them into plasma encoded pathways in a modular fashion using different plasmid combinations. We then explore alternative routes along the pathway, as identified by the hatched ellipses shown here, as well as using biocatalysts supplied by nature. We also had to repurpose selected catalysts to improve the target chemistry, especially for the ado enzyme, which is a slow enzyme that works best with long chain aldehydes and having assembled these early pathways, we then set out to optimize by switching in and switching out, new variants Or by eliminating competing pathways through targeted knockout of genes to ensure we direct metabolites to the desiredproduct propane, so repurposing of adio by protein engineering was the first challenge. The enzyme works best with long chain aldehydes and to get a molecular view of thisand how the substrate sits. We solve the crystal structure of adoin the presence of its surrogate ligand palmitic acid, which co-fur purifies with the enzyme from e coli, and here you can see that the substrate ax accesses the active sitethrough a long hydrophobic channel with the carboxyl group.being presented to the diane center, which is the the areaofuh of catalysis, we conjectured the steric blocking of this channel, would exclude long chain substrates and perhaps favor the binding of short chain aldehydes. So a number of single or multiple mutations were made, the most effective being the replacement of a residue alanine 134 for alanine. You can see that in the slide here you can see the red algae side chain blocking off that channel and the structure of that variant indicated. The design intentions were carried through in crystal structures with shorter chain substrates. We then introduced the n, the engineered enzymes into plasmic constructs where we had assembled parts of the pathway genes leadingfrom the cell metabolite acetyl coa through to the final product propane fermentation of a 12-hour period, analytical scale. That indicated that in fact, propane was now generated using this pathway, all beating relatively small amounts, but despite the low titers, this was the first clustering clostridium-like fermentation pathway shown to produce propane gas, and it establishes an important proof of concept. The titer is dependent on the metabolic root, followed, as indicated by the red and the green bars beyond theseproof of promptconcept. Studies at lab scale, exploratory, five and four hundred liter scales have also been demonstrated.and the low titra is clearly a challenge in part due to the very low activity of ado we've engaged in both direct evolution and rational engineering studies of ado. But improvements in catalytic activity here are hard-won and hindered by the fact that we're still unsure what is limiting in the overall catalytic cycle of this intriguing enzyme. So on this slide, you can visualizean air lift fermenter that we developed in c3 biotech the spin-out company to investigate early scale, up challenges of of propane production. Using the engineer, coalite strains that we produced e coli is supported using glycerol from a reprocessing plant from this movie, which i i hope works on screen here. Let me just generate, i guess it might not work, because i can't access my cursor. Oh there. It isfrom this movie here you cannot. Oh i'm not sure it's going to work. Oh there, it is, you can actually see a mixture of propane and other flammable gases burning from this deadly fermenter. There is propane in there it's not entirely propane. It'S a mixture of other flammable gases as well, but this really does at least demonstrate a proof of concept that propane can produceto some extentin this larger scale,fermented. There arechallenges here, uh. Clearly, this is not a system that we would want toscale up this at this stage,because ofthe low titus producedthe cost of of of setting up sterile fermentations uh. We with e coli and many of the engineering challenges that we set out and in the end we have decided that, in fact, ado is probably not the ideal enzyme to be supportingshort-chain alkane production in in microbial cell factories. So, armed withthat knowledgethat ado isn't likely to support this large-scale production in mib uh. A number of usin in the institute have been looking at other potentialuh enzymes that could give rise to flammable fuels. For example, we've had a an mib-wide program on mechanism and structure of a number of enzymes, which can be used to produce alkenes, alkanes and indeed terpene fuels that i've mentioned briefly. Some of those enzymes are shown here, but really the game changer for us was the report in science in 2017 of a new photo enzyme isolated from algae, which using blue light, can decarboxylate long chain fatty acids into shorter to short chain alkanes. So, within thatpaper in science, the structure of the enzyme was reported bysorry ital, and it's provided the the required insight into long chain fatty acid binding in the active site clef that could be targeted for rational design,towards substrates a notional catalytic Cycle was also presented by these authors involving fad photochemistry to decal oxalate, the fatty acid, using excited state, flavon chemistry and, as part of the characterization of the enzyme, we've done further spectroscopic analyses of this particular catalyst to determine its overall reaction mechanism. These studies were reported recently in acs catalysis earlier this year. In brief, we were able to demonstratethat a red intermediate is formed even under cryogenic conditions,that's below the glass phase, transition of proteins, implying that the chemical change is not dependent on larger scale. Protein motion, but the decay of that red intermediate is very much dependent on protein structural change, because that only happens at temperatures above the glass phase transition. I won't dwell on those studies today. The paper is there: if anyone's interested to follow up, we were also able using laser excitation experiments tolook atproton transfer and hydrogen transfer reactions associatedwith the formation decay of that red intermediate and we're able to begin to deconstruct the overall reaction.mechanism and proton transfer pathways and indeed identifykey residues in the active site, and i point you to the cysteine residue system 432 that we showed is involved in formation decay of that particular red intermediate. What that means is that we've been able to advance now our understanding of the overall reaction mechanism. First of all, this conserves cysteine residue is found in all fat fat analogues. Fap homologs are shown in the sequence alignment here, emphasizing its potential importance of the photochemistry uh. That cysteine is closeto the fad cofactor and we believe it gets involved in the chemistrythrough a series of hydrogen transfer and electron transfer reactions. Uh. Essentially, what happens is that following flavon excitation, we then get a homolytic fission of the carbon-carbon bond on the substrate to form co2 and an alkane radical, and that alkane radical is then satisfied by h. Atom transfer from this active site sustain to form a phylate radical species which can translate form an interaction with the fad, that's the rare intermediate and then relax back to the resting form of the enzyme. So, on with this knowledge, we now have a clear understanding of mechanism, and this can be factored into rational engineering of the enzyme specificity. Our strategy is shown here, of course, in classical anaerobic digestion, type processes or indeed other processes derived from widely available biomass. You can get volatile fatty acid streams. We can then think about decarboxylating those volatile fatty acids using a single enzymatic step using the photo d-cap oxalates to form propane, isobutane and butane. So our overall strategy was to go in that particular direction.but of course uh. The the fatty acid photo d-carboxylase predominantly works with long chain aldehydes, and our first challenge was really to try and reprofile if you like, the specificity of that enzyme,to workwithwith with shorter chainwith shorter chain fatty acids. So we created a series of mutant, constructs,informed bythe structureand you can see on thissequence window here we're able to identify residues which are involvedin redefining, if you like, the the substrate specificity of this enzyme, we've generated manyvariants ofoff of fap in an extensive mutagenesis cycle, some are single substitutions or there are multiple substitutionsbut we've been able to sort of uh. If you like, i identify a sequence window where key changes.can reallyalter thespecificity.of or or of this enzyme for short chainfor short chain,uh, volatile fatty acids - and we can see some of the screening outputs here. So here we now have variants which are able to work with both c3 and c4 hydrocarbon fatty acids and indeed c3c4 hydrocarbon blends - that's important because wherever you are in the world of course, lpg comprises propane, butane or other short chains, and you might want to fine-tune The lpg content, depending onthe type ofoffap enzyme,that that is using the microbial cell factory now previously i'd mentionedthatmost of our prototype work has been done inin in e coli uh. But really we need to translate that then intointo a more robustuh robust industrial host, so conventional fermentations are clearly very costly, both in terms of capex investments and ongoing opex running costs and fermentation typically uses extensive, expensive steel fermenters with monitoring systems. It requires aeration, mixing and dspsterilization costs and, of course,extensive use of fresh water, fresh water water. So we have a strong collaboration with george chen in chingua university in beijing and george is the sort of world leader in terms of usingextrema files or hello files as as hosts for next generation by technology. And we work with george in recent years to if you like, translate much of our chemicals pathways intohalophilic hosts and the beauty of that is that halomonascan use low-cost reactors. We don't needsterilization, because the high selenite negates sterilization processes. These strains will grow on sea water. They will use simple waste carbon sources as as growth feed stocks, they're genetically tractable and uh. It'S already demonstrated to be in an existing, robust industrial host. So our early lab scale work looked at propane production with both clean and crude biodiesel media, and you can see that on the slide here and we've been able to show production of propane inhale among us, as indicated in the topright hand,panelAnd, what's more if the variant enzymes are introduced into uh? Well, this is just a further a further description of what i've just described here you can see uh. The performance here is actually much improved above what we seeusing our e coli host, our highestpublished propane levels, are around about 0.2 grams per liter of culture. Halomonas has got a high tolerance to the substrate we use for this photocatalytic conversion uh. We can get growth in non-sterile, seawater,and and so on, and so forth. All the characteristics that you'd want tosee beginning to emerge out of this, this newthis new platform. What'S morewe canif we, if we place the variant enzymes into a photosynthetic organism such as cynical cystiswe can also demonstrate propane production from co2 feedstocks. This therefore opens up the exciting possibility of making gasoline hydrocarbon fuels from co2s the titers. In this case are lower than what we see in halomonus is clearly rounds of optimization to be done here, but again we establish an importantproof of proof of conceptfor further development of making fuelsfrom co2. So what i hope i've done is to give youa flavor of the type of trajectory that we're pursuing both academically,and and in our open access sort ofcommercial ventures. Uh. The sort of work that we're doing clearly is much more happening. That'S commercially sensitive in the company that i can't talk about to today, but what we have done is to demonstrate proof of concept for bio lpg production using engineered microbial cell factories.we've performed techno economics in lca to inform roots to scale production based on these foundational strains and c3. Biotech is now engaged in experimental pilot plant developments to guide scale up and to feed back into further iterations of strain engineeringto ultimately impact on the economics and productivity of production. I'M conscious i've probably gone over my time slightly, so i think that is where i will finish, but before i do that. I'D like to finish by really thanking many researchers who've contributed to the research programs. I'Ve discussed today. Our funding from various agencies, in particular, i'd like to thank the staff in symbia kent center at manchester, who done a lot of the strain automation of the strain engineering, but also the future brh, which is a second center. That'S needed risking much of the scale up work and then people in my own research group who've really pushed the lpg type work, but also important collaborators. We'Ve worked with patrick jones at imperial college, on this project in the early stages and and indeed in some of the cinema, sisters, work and also uh. My good collaborator in beijing, george, chenwith whom we've been doingmuch of the work with one halemona's funders, are, of courseukri, but increasingly we have industry funded programs coming from c3 biotech. That'S where i'll finish, and i'm certainly happy to take any questions if people have them. Thank you um. Thank you very much, nigel for a really excellent talk, a really thought-provoking talk as well especially for me, who's more sort of inorganic engineer than than bio. Um. Really fascinating, we do have a couple of questions already popping up on the the questions.maria asksor says it's an amazing example of targeted engineering of nature but you'd like to know about the economical viability of the process. Yeah the estimation of such price of the price of such a product, and do you need to purify due to lesser activity and, what's the most expensive in the dbtl cycle, yeah? Okay, both of those are excellent questions. We we've done quite a lot of early-stage techno-economicanalysisparticularly for the bio lpg, and you could imagine there. We'Ve got a real challenge. Lpg is not that expensive,and so to have a process. That'S competitive with with with existing manufacturing processes is uh. Is going to be a significant challenge? The answer here, i thinkis uh. A micro microbial cell factory, just making propane alone or making lpg alone is not, is not going to compete with cost, but the way forward, i think, is to take an a sort of more integrated by refinery type approach, but symbify that approach. What i mean by that is to take your your chassis that makeslpg and also have it to make multiple other products, and we've looked at that in detail in our published paper that came outearlier this year, where we've got different case scenarios. We'Ve done the techno economics and the lca and other types of approach for up to 10 or 11 different case studies. And as you follow through those case studies, then you can see that you can really bring the cost of manufacture down to the point where it becomesin our view, economically, a viable proposition and that's the approach we're taking in the company and and also the Approach that's been used to feed back into further engineering of the strains.second part of the question i think was to do with the right missing step in dbtl was that was that the? What was the most expensive step in the dbgosh? I think the most expensive step is staff resource, if i'm brutally honest and the capital investment is setting up the platformin terms of consumable running costs. I think that's really hard to to deconstruct. I i thinkyou know, as you can imagine, a platform of this type takes a lot of expensive equipment and just running and maintaining you know, multiple mass spectrometers, robotics so on and so forth is a constant manager's nightmare in terms of finding money to make Sure that that that that is kept up and workingso actually, i think that's where the the real the real cost is that and staff resource, consumable costs and time perhaps less so. Thank you. I hope that answers your question. Maria stephen wallace would like to ask um. I thank you for a great talk and says he was just wondering how photo active your d. Carboxylase is when it's inside a cell and also inside a fermenter yeah. That'S a really good question too, because, as you know, the challenge we have with any photo active system is like penetration into the cells and that's going to be an engineering challenge. Moving forward,we're aware of that. We'Ve done some scoping experiments on lab scale to try and try and tackle with that. Certainly in a lab scale, fermenter one liter half a liter we can. We can show that we can drive the reaction in live cells. The problem of working with the photobiocatalyst is that in the excited state, the enzymes pretty unstable,the the chemistry is, is reactive chemistry. So actually your enzyme undergoes inactivation pretty quickly, even in a live cell. So you have to constantly regenerate your your biomass to recover the catalyst it's a bit like you do in the chemical industry. You make a catalyst that gets poisoned. You'Ve got to remake it. The good thing about biology is remaking. That catalyst is not that expensive. You just regrow the bugs, so there are a number of issues we have to. We have to deal with here. Light penetration is one we're generating catalyst, as the other. Thank you and stephen also asks. What do you think the future role of traditional synthetic chemists will be as strain engineering becomes more and more routine and we gradually move away from petrochemicals? Well, i got ta be careful. What i say here you can probably tell by i i'm passionate about you know what the role for by founders is, but it's complementary to what we, what we achieveusing conventionalsynthetic approaches, there'll always be chemistry that biology can't dobut there might Also be chemistry that biology do that chemistry can't do so. You know i really see this as a twin track approach really and getting a closer tie into developingprograms or processes in which synthetic biologyis part of the is part of the journey. I think is an important thing. Let me give you an example: synthetic biology is really good at making carbon scaffolds. As i showed you today, terpene scaffolds, tailoring the scaffolds through very precise, oxy, functionalization or or further additions might either be a synthetic chemistry challenge or it might be a sort of whole cell or purified biocatalysis type. The sort of thing we do in the uk by catalysis sort of theme of the of the catalysis hub, so i don't think any of these things are exclusive. They have to be integrated as part of a sort of hybrid work stream moving forward, but i think symbian can certainly makescaffolds very effectively and cheaply. Hope that answers your question. Stephencooles says grants karen sorry. I pronounced that really badly. I'M sureasks: did you manage to ex express difficult to express membrane-bound, cytochrome p450 enzymes in e coli, which are part of these processes? So we stayed away from membrane-bound sort of more mammalian-type eukaryotic p-450s, and we - and everyone knows who works on p450s - that that working with membrane-bound systems is is is a bit of a nightmareand in fact, probably one of the reasons why p-450s are not widely Exploited in in conventional industrial black catalysis, we tend to concentrate onmutants and variant forms of bacterial systems, which are well characterized p450 cam p450bn3, those sort of enzymes. There are many variants now available from labs all over the world and that's the that's. The sort of repository of enzymes that we usedfor the basis of that work, um. Having said it, we were able to find catalysts that that could really oxy functionalize at all different positions of of the terpenes that we that we discussedbill stibbs would like to know. Is there a market for bio-based short-chain fatty acids?i'd like to know that, for obvious reasons, and if anyone knows a market for short-chain, smelly,volatile acids,then please, let me know, drop me. An email i'd be delighted to hear from you. I'M sure there isbut uh. I don't quite know the details of that. So, if anyone's got any insight, please let me know: okay, you and mcdonald would like uh. Thank you for the talk and ask um. Is there a place for multi-species-strained communities of bacteria to improve stability and synergy and mitigate species, strain specific weaknesses for large-scale fermentation biosynthesis, as opposed to string the singular strains such as the dbt cycles? I i think the answer that is is yes, very likely, very probably for a variety of reasons.shuttling, intermediates out of oneor first of all, getting a complex metabolic pathway to work in a single host is, is probably quite difficult. There'S a real challenge in terms of the engineering of biology that you have to do, making two smaller strains that communicate with each other to perhapsshare the products of one as a substrate for anotheris is an obvious strategy. There are many other strategies that that might require you to work with multipleorganisms uh. So, in short, yesi could probably talk for another half hour on the sort of application areas where that might be the case. I'M probably not appropriate for today, but certainly yes, i think multi multi cultures are are are are certainly on. The cardsmohammed javed would like to know, does are terpenes produced in the engineered e coli with growth, or is it produced as a secondary metabolite? In the stationary phase, yeahyeah- i don't have hard data to show you on that, butcertainly in early stages of growth. Uh. A lot of the strategies we use in the lab are classical sort of what the molecular biologists would know. Get your biomass up and then induceand switch on your chemistry,yeah. I think at an academic level. That'S what we would doso you tend to sort of get production toward the end of the growth cycle when you're approaching station phase. Clearly, in a more industrial context, where you don't want to be using inducible promoters, you might be working off more constitutive promoters that don't require induction. You might have a different regime. Many of these compounds, however cytotoxic so you've also got to get that balance right as well. You don't want to make it too early so that you, you start interfering with your biomass accumulation. So it's a bit of a fine balancing act, if i'm honest and we're exploring many of thosedifferent regimes,in in some of the scaling work that we're doing. He does ask what is the yield gram per gram per subgram per gram of substrate uh? I do well again depends which product you're talking about [ Laughter ]. So i i i don't have that data for for the terpene prototype pathwaysmainly because we haven't determined that accurately. I think these are prototype strains the ones i talked about today. We have to go through optimization processes before we start looking at stoichiometris of conversion. We have done that sort of work for our lpg work. I'M not sure i want to sort of share some of that data with you at this stage, because there's some commercial sensitivity, but we we have done some of that work with some of our adapter strains. We have an anonymous question, which is: will such synthetic biology synthesized substances get rejected by the public in the same manner as gmos? If so, how can we convince people? Well, the hope is notand the lesson has to be learned and, of course, when student, anabolic research councils and other funding came into this from the government injection in 2014-13, then that was clearly very much on the on the agenda and research councils. Quite rightly,were determined that that conversation should happen early on, so that we could de-riskthe acceptability of the engineering that we're doingwithin the centers. So, in the manchester center we we we have great leadership in this space fromsomeone called phil shapiro, who has driven really quite a lot of theresponsible research innovation work in the center and and offers some leadership nationally in that as well uh. We hope that those sort of conversations will will prevent another gmosituation backfiring on the on the symbio world um. Thank you, chris newman. Thanks for your talk and asks, how far away are you from a commercial production of a mono 13, i can't tell you that i'm afraid too sensitivewatch this space, [ Laughter, ], sorry, chris, adam winifreuth asks um. Oh so he's a biochemistry undergraduate and was wondering what skills you would encouragefor him to learn. If you wanted to get involved in bioengineering, that's a tough one, and i think you know there's a lot of skills. I mean it really is. Truly. Is an interdisciplinary challenge and it's exciting for pg students who want to sort of work in this space. But you know you really have to sort of be agile and you've got to be prepared to sort of jump into the deep end i mean. I know i trained as an enzymologist, but you know i don't know where i am these days and some some would say a jack of all trades master of none. That'S probably quite right,because you know we we dabble in so much different stuff and - and i think you have to do as a synthetic biology you have to do some of the you know the computational design work. You'Ve got to do the analytical chemistry, the strain engineering, the underpinning molecular biology,there's lots of conventional chemistry involved as well. It'S a it's. It'S a big ask for any anybody,training. So i would say you know, look around at the training opportunities that you have. We think we do pretty well in the mib, i'm sure the centers. Do it equally. Well, it's just that. You know you need to find that sort of environment that supports it. Yeahthere was an understood from chris newmangovind, sorry gavin says, is indeed a good host for phb was further path. Was the pathway further engineered for diverting flux from phb to propane? Also, sorry, i missed how you store the propane in the lab environment. Thank you yeah, so i can't tell you anything about the details of the engineering because again, there's there's sensitivities, i'm afraid in that process i apologize for not being able to give details. Recovering propane from life cell bioreactors is relatively straightforward. Of course it's the gas. So you don't have the same problem you have with other biofuels, which are either stuck in the cell or stuck in the liquid of the reactor. It comes off as a gas, so you can just do simple, liquefactionit's standard technology in the propane industry. My business partner he's in the propane industry. He knows how to do that. So we have an instant network of expertise that we can draw on to to help us. Do it. Okay and jordy asks um. Is there any opportunity to make more valuable bio products upstream from propane, for example, acrylic acid in principle? Yes,you know as academics, of course, we're looking to derive value from existing pathways that we have in our center symbiote cam and indeed in future brh. A lot of the sort of initial pathways that we've developed we're looking to derive value from them by you know we call them our gateway pathways because they open up then roots to to other close by chemicals of value um. So we've done this recently with flavonoids. For example, or an initial entry pathway, there was elaborated further to make. You know different types of flavonoids, so yes in principle, absolutely there's there's always that opportunity and it's relatively straightforward to do that. Well, i think you can tell from the the width of the questioning it was a very well received talk um. I think we've come to the end of the questions now. i'm sure all the participants are clapping at their screens and saying. Thank you very much for such a inspiring talk and i'd like to say. Thank you very much for giving up your time to give us this talk. It'S been excellent. Thank you very much. It'S been a pleasure. I'Ve enjoyed it and i hope people have got something to take away with them. So thank you very much for inviting me. Thank you very much. Okay, goodbye everyone. Thank you for joining us um. I hope see you next month for our next webinar and lots of thanks on the chat. Okay, i will end the meeting and the recording will go up on the website once it's been processed. Okay, thanks \""
